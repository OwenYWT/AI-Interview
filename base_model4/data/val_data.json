        "Transcript": "Interviewer:  How are you doing today?|Interviewee:  Good  how are you?|Interviewer:  Good.  Tell me more about your background.|Interviewee:  So  my background is primarily in energy work.  So  I'm a chemical engineering student and I'm very interested in not only alternative energy but the optimization of our traditional energy resources.  Um  so that's  that's where my  uh  background in  well in gas comes in.  Um  but also some of my research interests are you know  kind of scientific ideas.||Interviewer:  Great.  Um  do you think you're a leader.  Tell me why.|Interviewee: Um  I definitely think I am.  Uh  partially because even when I'm not the designated leader somehow it turns into me leading the team.  But I really enjoy that.  I think that one of the most satisfying feelings is having your team tel you that you're doing a great job or that they think that um that success can be highly attributed to you.  So  I think that in terms of my leadership style I always want to bring out the strengths of  the team members.  So I think that's really how my position as a leader really works.  I try to figure out what would maximize the potential of this team member or that team member.  And how can we bring all of those together.||Interviewer:  Great.  Do you consider yourself a team player.  Can you give me an example of where there was a conflict in your team and you had to resolve it.|Interviewee: Um  yeah  so  I definitely consider myself a team player.  It's tough to be a good leader without being a good team player.  Ah  but one instance where I was both the leader and also a team player um  was in the Society of Women Engineers banquet.  So  when we planned it  it was...I'm the vice president of corporate relations and I have six people who work with me and we planned a banquet for about 200 people  both company representatives and students.  And um  and it's a very collaborative effort.  Like  I may be the VP but we're all you know  pulling a lot of the weight.  And so during the actual event  we had four company representatives for two different companies show up to the event without RSVP-ing or anything.  Uh  it was  the selection for the companies was pretty extensive and the selection for the students was pretty extensive.  So what we were trying to do was get a good range of industries and then match students with their interests.  So it's not something where you can be like  Oh yeah  sit right down but  so  in terms of being a team player  they approached one of the other members of the team.  She didn't really know what to do um  kind of bounced it to a few different people but I knew that that was something that wouldn't look good.  So I definitely helped her out  out of that awkward situation and kind of took the blame on myself essentially because these representatives were pretty angry that  Oh  you don't have our name tags  you don't have our seats?  What's going on?  And so I  you know  part of being a team player is knowing when it's best to take the blame on yourself.  And in the end we found places for them to sit.  So  we had some no-show students  you know  among like a hundred whatever students you definitely have people that don't show up.  So they didn't get to sit with like exactly the right students or anything but we found them a place and fed them dinner.  So  that helped.||Interviewer:  Great.  If you had the option to change one thing about yourself what would it be?|Interviewee:  I wish I was more patient.  Um  I think I  a lot of times and very eager to start a task.  This especially comes out  uh  we're in a lab group right now.  Or  I'm in a lab class and I work with a lab group  um  in that class and we are all  we kind of have this trait of  um  oh as soon as the chemicals are out on the bench  oh let's mix this  let's do this  let's do this.  But a lot of time we end up finishing a little bit later than other groups because we have to  we problem solve.  We get all the problems first  you know  other people not having necessarily tried this we find that this doesn't work at all.  So  we face all those hurdles first whereas if we had  if we could take a few minutes wait  think it out  uh  maybe let somebody else try something first for a change  um  I think that would helps us be a little bit more effective.  And I think in other situations too it's kind of strategic and advantageous to wait but it's sometimes hard for me to see those opportunities.  So I definitely  that's definitely something that I've been working on  is  you know  when  when is that also a viable option to just sit back for a few days and just think about it. ||Interviewer:  Okay.  And why do you think you should get the job?|Interviewee: I think that I would bring a great deal of enthusiasm.  In addition to the skills and background that I have  I think that I'm so excited  um  for the work that your company is doing and to kind of play off the other members of the team as well.  Um  so not just stick to my own project but also be contributing to the other projects that are going on and try to find synergies within our team.",

        "Transcript": "Interviewer: Ready?|Interviewee: Yeah  sure.|Interviewer: How are you doing today?|Interviewee: Ummm  I'm great. Thank you.|Interviewer: OK Tell me a bit about your background|Interviewee: OK well I am a math major  but I have a lot of background in kind of different areas. So freshman year I did some work  um  at the Department of Energy  um  working the CFO's office so I'm getting kind of a feel for the budget um also risk matrices. Then I kinda branched more towards CS aspects  so  I did a bit of coding here and there in most research aspects and also  um  for companies.|Interviewer: Great. And do you think you are a leader  and why?|Interviewee: Ummm  definitely. So I'm president of The Undergrad Society of Learner Math and this basically gives me a great opportunity to  um  kind of help underclassmen and  also  younger girls  so those in highschool  middle school and kind of get them to become more active in the math community um participate in more events  even networking things  so  uh  anything with companies but also research with professors. It's a great way to kind of help other people who haven't really seen those opportunities yet.|Interviewer: And do you consider yourself a team player? Can you give an example of when there was a conflict in your team and you resolved it?|Interviewee: Yeah  soum  last winter I was working in the Boston area at Autotegrity which is like a online marketing start up. um   I don't know how much familiarity you have with  um  coding like repository systems  but  basically if someone  um  uploads like their work to the server and it doesn't work basically everyone elses stuff doesn't work either. So there's like a little column button type thing in rebuild which is called the blame button so you could kind of blame people. So every once in a while it would occur where someone would screw up the code and that would make everyone's work stop instead of you know blaming the one person telling them to fix the code we would all kind of look at where it went wrong and how we could improve upon that further instead of just fixing one persons code. So it was kind of a group effort to see how much we could all improve from the one mistake. |Interviewer: And if you were given the option to change one thing about yourself what would it be?|Interviewee: I guess I would probably try to ask more questions. Um  in general if I get directions which are really broad where I don't know where to start searching um instead of asking my higher up i would probably just automatically start looking at everything and start floating around. I guess it would be good to get more like to the point.|Interviewer: And why do you think you should get the job|Interviewee: Um like I mentioned before i think I have a good combination of leadership skills as well as um team player abilities. In addition to this I am pretty qualified I believe in terms of my academic classes that I have taken and also my extracurriculars have demonstrated I have a deep passion for math. And aside from that  I have many internships which have honed my skills in the work place.",

        "Transcript": "Interviewer: How are you doing today?|Interviewee: I'm doing very well. How are you?|Interviewer: Good. So  tell me about yourself.|Interviewee: I'm currently a junior at MIT. I'm studying biology. Ummm I am interested in pursuing some sort of a future in medicine  but I don't know if necessarily like the medschool route or more the research side  but you know having to do with patient care and drugs and things like that. So  within the broader field but I'm not sure specifically what path yet. |Interviewer: Okay  great. So  tell me about a time when you demonstrated leadership.|Interviewee: Umm  okay. So umm the summer after my sophomore year of high school I actually went on a leadership trip. Um so it was through uh my summer camp and some other camps are a part of the same foundation and we actually went on a trip to Israel for the summer. |Interviewer: Wow  okay.|Interviewee: And it was the first time I'd ever been  which was very exciting um. And it was a very cool experience 'cause not only were they teaching a lot of leadership skills  but also a lot of you know the daily activities we did like going for really long hikes and things just kind of brought out that innate like  'someone has to make sure everyone brought enough water.'|Interviewer: Right  right right right right right.|Interviewee: And  you know  make sure the group's staying together and things like that  um. So that was definitely something that I think impacted me a lot.|Interviewer: Mhmm.|Interviewee: And I think  you know  in other leadership roles  you know  even in a small group project or something. A lot of the time I find myself reflecting back to that trip and kind of saying  'Okay  we were in a tough spot like that before.'|Interviewer: Mhmm.|Interviewee: 'How did we kinda rally the group back together?'. Something like that.|Interviewer: Great  okay. And can you tell me about a time when you were working on a team and faced a challenge? What did you do to solve that problem?|Interviewee: Umm  sure. So  a time when I was working on a team. So I think  um  this situation arises a lot of times in lab. |Interviewer: Okay.|Interviewee: So I was  um  this past summer I was back in Israel and working in a lab at the Hebrew University.|Interviewer: Mhmm.|Interviewee: Um  and it was a pretty small lab. I was working um for one of the post-ocs and then there are about four other people in the lab. And so things like that kind of came up all the time where it would be a matter of  'Okay  we don't have the exact materials that we needed to do the experiment. Can I borrow this from this lab?' |Interviewer: Mhmm.|Interviewee: 'Can someone check down the hall  if maybe they have this?' |Interviewer: Mhmm.|Interviewee: And just kind of that group mentality of making sure everyone was getting their experiments done. Um and then it was also interesting 'cause there were a lot of language barriers that were going on in lab.|Interviewer: Oh  okay.|Interviewee: Um 'cause there were some Israelis that were working there.|Interviewer: Mhmm. |Interviewee: And then one of the PhD students was from Russia  and then two of the post-ocs were from India. Um and so the common language among them was English  but in sort of a broken-down manner in different ways.|Interviewer: Mhmm.|Interviewee: So that was kind of interesting also coming in and sort of having to step into that role of almost like translating English to English for people|Interviewer: Right  right right.|Interviewee: And checking emails and making sure they made sense  and things like that.|Interviewer: Okay. Right. So  can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what you're doing to overcome it?|Interviewee: Sure. Uh  I think sometimes I tend to be a little bit on the shy side. Especially um like if I'm the person coming into a new group or a new experience. And I think I just kind of have to remind myself like  there's a reason why I'm here.|Interviewer: Mhmm.|Interviewee: And I can add something to the experience  even if it's not in a major sort of leadership necessarily role. Like for example  the lab last summer  I was the only undergraduate working there. And so that kind of brought out that shyer side.|Interviewer: Mhmm.|Interviewee: 'Cause I walked in and  you know  everyone had already been working there and they were all much older and much more established in their fields. Um  so just kind of keep  keeping up the reminders that like  'I'm here to get something out of this experience and hopefully I can help out the lab  while at the same time realizing that  you know  I'm not necessarily going to come up with a big breakthrough today. And that's okay.' |Interviewer: Mhmm  mhmm.|Interviewee: 'And  you know  I still need to feel comfortable here; I need to add what I can  and then the rest will fall into place when it does.' And I think just  you know  keeping those reminders coming that I don't have to be like the person solving the problem right away has kind of helped me to take a step back  relax; see what I  what I can add to the table without freaking out that it's not enough.|Interviewer: Okay  great. And  last question: Why do you think we should hire you?|Interviewee: Um  I think for me where I'm  where I am at this point  where I'm deciding between sort of going the medical school route or the research route;|Interviewer: Mhmm.|Interviewee: The more time I spend in a hospital setting I think definitely will enable me to kind of make those distinctions between if it's the one-on-one patient care that I care more about  or if it's the sort of overarching like how are these people being cured more from a scientific standpoint?|Interviewer: Mhmm.|Interviewee: Um  and I think just sort of that open-mindedness towards both sides will help out the hospital a lot. Because you know it's always good to have people that are interacting between the pure doctors and the pure scientist level.|Interviewer: Okay.|Interviewee: And someone that has interest in both areas and can kind of mediate and interact between those two.|Interviewer: Great  okay.",

        "Transcript": "Interviewer: So  can you tell me about yourself?|Interviewee: Sure  so I'm a senior at MIT in management and computer science. Uhm  I'm really interested in the intersection of the two. So  you know  not just  uhm  you know  how computers can  you know  you know  how  like the best algorithms to do about computers? like you know inventing the next algorithm  the next compression algorithm  not really something that I'm interested in doing. But uh really finding how computers can help apply to peoples lives and make new businesses or improve existing businesses. |Interviewer: Excellent. Let me open my questions up here. So  uhm  can you tell of a time where you demonstrate leadership?|Interviewee: Sure  so  uhm  I guess I'd say earlier this year. So I'm actually the president of Baker house and earlier in the beginning of the year in MIT we had this process called REX; Residence Exploration where all the dorms try and throw events and somehow  you know  recruit or retain the freshmen that they have. Uhm  and  the REX Event that we had uh  we threw a bunch of events  had about ten workers that we had  were able to give early arrival to. So free housing. Uh  so we ran about five or six events the largest of which was a party where we had over seven-hundred people attend. |Interviewer: Wow. So can you tell me about a time where you're working on a team and face a challenge? how did you go about resolving it?|Interviewee: Sure. So I think there's  you know  always been challenges. So last summer when I was at Disney  uhm  there were  there was some disagreement about uh  how we should  when we should schedule  the  uh  what week we should schedule the  uh  trial for. Uhm  and there was some disagreement about whether we should have it later because of uhm  uh  dates for when the program would be ready but if we had it passed a certain date then we'd have to have the app also consider time zone issues. So basically just discussed with all the stake holders and let them know that  you know  by changing this date  pushing it back  we're adding scope to the app and we're going to have to make additional development changes and see if they would be able to be flexible to change it back. |Interviewer: Ahh  that makes sense.|Interviewee: Yep.|Interviewer: Uhm  so  uh  tell me about your greatest weakness and what you've done to over come it. |Interviewee: Sure. So I think the  the problem  uhm  that I have the most is  uh  in delegating task to people. So  uhm  I want to make sure that things are done properly so I tend to overly control on things. So basically I've been thinking to myself alright is this something core that I really have to do? no. I think let's. you know  lets get someone else to do it  and that way also they also they learn it so  you know  when I graduate they're able to take on that role. |Interviewer: Mhmm. Uhm. Thanks. So I guess thinking  uhm  about a job that you like to apply for.|Interviewee: Sure.|Interviewer: Uh  Why should we hire you for this position?|Interviewee: Sure. I think uhm  I combine  you know  technical expertise with uh  business expertise and product expertise. So  hiring me as a product manager for your mobile app I think is  uh  would be optimal because I have expertise in all these areas and I've worked in all these areas in the past  uhm  and I'm able to bring that expertise to your organization in a way that I think few other candidates  uhm  have. |Interviewer: Ah  well thank you for coming.|Interviewee: Thank you for having me.",

I'm studying brain and cognitive science. I'm interested in studying cognitive neuroscience in the future. Probably systems level.|Interviewer: Great. Tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership.|Interviewee: Ok. Umm  well  this past summer I was in China. And  umm  I was helping out with this cognitive learning program. And what they do  is they try take principles  umm  learned through research  and apply those in the classroom. And so-|Interviewer: OK.|Interviewee:- we were applying those  umm  to students who were in sixth grade  trying to teach them English. And  it was  it was great. So  I got to actually  like  umm  go there and teach a class of sixth graders for the whole summer. So  umm  and they let me develop some of their curriculum  which was very cool. And  umm and it was a great experience overall.|Interviewer: Great. Tell me about a time you were working on a team and faced a challenge. How did you solve that problem.|Interviewee: Ok. Umm  well  actually  a part of the same program  uh  we were trying to put up videos of the teaching to give  umm  examples for other people. And  uh  none of us knew how to program or anything like that  and we were  we were in China  so it was  umm  both a language barrier and also  you know like  overcoming that  like  knowledge gap of not knowing how to program. So  what we ended up doing was  like  trying to find a Chinese student who was studying computer science  and  umm  in Beijing  and  the language thing did come in to play  but  umm  but eventually  we were able to  like  sort of  get through that. It was a challenge all the way through.|Interviewer: Mmhm. Great.

        "Transcript": "Interviewer: So  please tell me about yourself.|Interviewee: Umm  like where I'm from  that type of stuff? Okay  umm  I'm Junior  M.I.T.. I come from South Florida  born and raised  so cold weather's kind of rough for a guy like me but that's alright. It's kind of a nice break from the heat of South Florida. Umm  I've been playing music ever since I was four  so that's kind of been a big part of my life. Umm  but music tech  I mean  technology honestly also  so umm. Course two here  which is Mechanical Engineering  um  but I'm also dabbling in Electrical  looking along for sides of control that type of stuff. Robotics  if you will. And just had one of my  my second or third robot finished last week  which was a freakin' nightmare. But you know  it's ok  it's done  it was  it was a good time  so  yeah. That's  that's what I do. Yeah  umm  I guess that's...|Interviewer: That's good for you! That's good  that's good.|Interviewee: Yeah  alright.|Interviewer: Uh  excellent. Robot building is always a fun pastime. |Interviewee: Yeah.|Interviewer: So  can you tell me about a time where you demonstrated leadership?|Interviewee: Leadership? Um  Well I guess I'm  uh  usually pretty calm and collected  so  if I ever notice  like  in a group setting if someone's like  you know  there's  there's disagreement between the two  like in my robotics group  for example. The two guys  they're best buds  but they often  like  just get really heated  like  you know  I  eff you  why  why don't we just do this  and that type of stuff. So...|Interviewer: Yeah. |Interviewee: ... In order to  like  keep it going and being productive  someone has to be like you know  just  guys  just calm down and keep doing it  so that's  that's like  just  here and there. Not really super-like I'm in control  you know  at least saying guys  we need to calm down and take a step forward. I feel like that's a little  minor leadership role I've got to take there. Um  other leadership roles  um  I  I play in a group  like a band  jazz group  so I often  you know  we all got to get together  and like  kind of talk. Any  any group setting in which I'm often in  I have to  like  somebody has to take control  and I don't often take control initially  but  you know  if something is not going in a certain direction  or the right direction  I often feel like maybe I can push it there very subtly. So  leadership in a very subtle way  but not in a  like  a bam  I'm telling you what to do.|Interviewer: Anyway. |Interviewee: That's  that's what I like doing.|Interviewer: Ah  that make's sense. So uh  tell me a time when you worked on a team and you faced a challenge. How did you go about solving it?|Interviewee: Um  okay  so  for example  the robotics group  um  we worked very last minute  and just having to be one of those things where we were all busy with other things  and we didn't really think about the scheduling  like when it was actually  when the project was actually going to be due. So  um  basically we all had to work really hard  last minute  and  of course  you know  things don't always go according to plan  so we  like  we tried to build one thing  and machine something  and it ended up not being perfect the first time  so we have to go back and redesign it  or re-machine it  so uh  we had to re-machine a few things a couple times. And  you know  it's like  six in the morning  and you've been working in the lab for like  thirteen hours and you've got to keep going  so  you've got to stay positive and keep  and  you know  even though you may not finish  or like  you know  you kind of  you can't really think about not finishing. You just have to go for it  keep finishing  keep working  eventually you're good  with the mind set that you are going to finish. So that's  uh  adversity in that way. Just  you know  always stay positive  and keep looking towards the future  keep working.|Interviewer: Yes. So  can you tell me about one of your weaknesses  and what you've done to try and overcome it?|Interviewee: So um  time-management  um  is one of my weaknesses  which is not always the best to admit in an interview  but you know  whatever  uh  that's alright. What I've been doing to get better about it  is  you know  sometimes you've got to look like  even a week in advance  I've discovered  especially at M.I.T.  isn't as far as you need to go. So  like this  this week for instance  I had  like  three  like  a final robot project  another presentation I had to take care of  and  you know  a lab  a couple P-sets. Like  you just  I didn't realize how much work was coming up until like  last Thursday or something like that  which is when I started working  but even then  you know  I didn't have enough time. I really should have started working  you know  Monday  on it  when I was just relaxing  and was like Oh  you know. I've got P-sets to do this week  but I can really relax and it will be all right. So  uh  in terms of improving that  just I  you know  got to work  write up a schedule  and look  really far in advance  make sure I really see what's coming. Yeah  so I've been trying  I've been being better. It started off  I started college  like  I didn't see things for like  three days in advance  two days in advance. Now it's kind of like  a week  week and a half I'm looking in advance. I'm getting there  slowly but surely. Yeah.|Interviewer: And  now think of a job you'd like to have.|Interviewee: Okay.|Interviewer: You have one in mind? |Interviewee: Uh  yeah sure.|Interviewer: So why should we hire you? |Interviewee: For that job  you mean?|Interviewer: Yeah. |Interviewee: Umm  I feel like I know what I'm doing now. Um  I'll say there was a point in time where I didn't feel like I knew what I was doing  and I've been one of those guys that  like  you know  you can apply to a job  and say  you know  yeah  there's no harm in applying  which I've kind of figured out  eventually  yeah there is no harm in applying  I agree. But  at the same time  I feel like there's kind of  like a  an obligation to actually know what you're doing for that job  and right now I feel like I know what I'm doing. At least  a lot more so than I did last year  or even last semester  so at the rate I'm going  I feel like  you know  another semester of classes that I'm taking  I'll really know what I'm doing  and then some more time in the field  or at the job  it'll piece together and I'll actually feel pretty confident. So  that's...|Interviewer: Okay.|Interviewee: ... That's why  I guess.|Interviewer: Well thank you.|Interviewee: Yeah.|Interviewer: I appreciate you coming today.",

I came to meetings and made sure everyone was on task  made sure |Interviewer: Mmm.|Interviewee: that everybody had an awareness of what could go wrong as well as what could  um  what kind of repercussions we might be expecting if things did fall out of hand with the high  high profile speakers-|Interviewer: Sure.|Interviewee:  as well as some  you know  some contentious issues-|Interviewer: Sure. ||Interviewee: being discussed  so  um  yeah I did my best  to really pull the team together as best as I could. |Interviewer: Great. |Interviewee: Um  I didn't have an official leadership role-|Interviewer: Mhmm.|Interviewee: So  my participation was ambiguously defined  but  um  it was fun having  uh  having a role.|Interviewer: Great. And tell me about a time you were working on a team a faced a challenge. How did you solve that problem? |Interviewee: Um  that's a good question. Um  so I was on the orientation group  I was an orientation leader this- |Interviewer: Mhmm. |Interviewee: this  the beginning of this year  and so  we paired off into different groups  uh  we were the brown team  and we had a few problems with getting energy with the team  and  uh  all of these freshman we knew that they were excited to be there- |Interviewer: Of course. |Interviewee: We knew that they wanted to get to know each other and MIT  but there was just  there was something blocking them from talking and from getting out of orientation what they should have  so  we  uh  we pulled together as a bit of a brown group team  we had a group discussion  after I think it was the second day  and  we took this  um  we took a few tries to pull together some new ice breakers that hadn't been in the booklet that they prepared us for  and just  uh  whipped that out the next day  started yelling  got the kids off their feet and jumping  and um  my  one of my other co-orientation leaders and I were yelling different questions at them and they had to pair up or group up based on the question that we asked them  and   it didn't really work necessarily  um  everybody participated though and it got them  got the blood moving  and it go them kind of talking to new people  so even though the game didn't have a point  it ended up being kind of fun  it was a good  good way of getting to know my teammates a well. |Interviewer: That's great.  |Interviewee: So we worked together really well on that. |Interviewer: Alright. Can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what you are doing to over come it? |Interviewee: Yes. Um  so I have a weakness for over-committing sometimes  and  uh  what I have been doing in the last year or so  well since I came to MIT  but particularly this year is cutting back on things that don't mean much to me. Cutting back on things that are  that have always just been interest that I never see myself progressing in. So  um  for example  I was  uh  I took a small leadership role in my sorority  like  my  my freshman year  but I wasn't  I don't see myself going very far in leadership in my sorority  so I cut that kind of thing out and I've been focusing on classes  sailing  I'm on the sailing team  and  uh  Amnesty International  and those are my three main focus things  so although  I do do other things. Like I was and orientation leader  um  when I have time I give tours  from  thats my job campus tour guiding  but  um  I've been getting better  I've been staying more on track with classes this way  and  um  having sailing has definitely helped  so a bit of self-discipline-|Interviewer: Right. |Interviewee: And  uh  cutting back on things has  helping me  uh  not overcommit. |Interviewer: Good. And  why do you think we should hire you? |Interviewee: Um  because I've researched into your country  sorry into your company  and  um  I think  uh  I think it's  I see a lot of  I see a lot it in the experience that I've had  in  I've had international experience in companies of a scales similar to yours  although  it was in the research department  um  and  I think I cold bring that  coo-  that  um  international perspective  I've lived in several countries as well  uh  and I have  besides being and engineer  I have a lot practice with team work and with leadership roles in my community and my student groups  even in my p-set groups  um  doing homework. We have to pull together a lot of presentations and a lot of  uh  group reports where the materials signs major here  and  I've really  uh  I've developed a lot of skills that I think will really help your company.  |Interviewer: Great.",

        "Transcript": "Interviewer: Can you tell me a little bit about your background?|Interviewee: I'm a student here at MIT  I'm in my third year as a junior  um  and I'm studying chemical biological engineering with a minor in economics. And so  as part of that I've uh taken coursework in transport processes  thermodynamics  chemical biological processes  and things like that. And also some macro  micro  public policy classes with the econ. And then I'm also doing research in chemical engineering laboratory here for a year and a half studying yeast  um  and different ways of doing transcription factors and how they relate then to promoter architecture and the dynamics that are behind that. So  lot of bio chemical engineering complications. And I also did some research this past summer in a systems biology lab in Madrid  Spain  um  so a little more biology related  so  those are most of my technical background.|Interviewer: Excellent. Do you think you're a leader? Tell me why.|Interviewee: Yeah  so um  I definitely think I'm a leader and that's actually something that's come to define a lot of my time here at MIT is leadership. Um  and so I think I'm a leader both because of the actions I've taken and also the mindset I have and as actions  I guess both of those things are important. So to give an example  um  I'm currently in a position of leadership in a club on campus  our Habitat for Humanity club  um  where I serve as the president of the club and I think I started off as a freshman  um  just participating  I really like community service so I volunteered with them a bit to go help build houses in the Boston/Cambridge area  um  and then I was fairly proactive which led me to start organizing those builds that I was going on  I figured I was benefiting from them  so I wanted to be able to give back and organize them so I ran for the exec of Habitat for Humanity here and started helping organize them  and then from there I went on to wanting to do more  and so now I'm president and run the exec and get to do everything that the club does  and so  um  I think that kind of drive and that desire to move up and give back and contribute and also make things happen definitely is characteristic of a leader. Um  and obviously  the position I'm currently in is one that demands leadership. So I think that's just one illustrative example of why I'm a leader.|Interviewer: Yes very good. So uh  are you a team player? Can you tell me about a time when you worked on a team and faced a challenge? How did you go about solving it?|Interviewee: Yeah  um  so I definitely think I'm a team player  um  and I think MIT especially is really conducive to teamwork. Um  but I'll look at a example of team work than relates actually to  um  I'm also involved in leadership within my fraternity. And so  as a part of that  um  we have a five person exec that uh I wasn't on to begin with  but uh  I've now loosened up and wanted to take on more leadership  help out  and so I'm currently on. And so  as a part of that five person exec  um  we've had to do a lot of teamwork. There's five of us  there's uh  my fraternity has seventy people. Um  so it's very large and it requires a lot of working together in order to  um  accomplish really any task. And so I think  um  one illustrative example is we wanted to put on a philanthropy event that I was spearheading in my position. I was doing brotherhood development activities  like a philanthropy even. And so  we haven't really had much precedent  we haven't had an event in a couple of years  um  and so I had come up with a summer with an event based off some stuff for other friends and other schools who I've talked to. Um  and so I had the idea for the event and then I had to work with these other four members to kind of lead the rest of our brotherhood in putting on the event  organizing it  um  and there was a lot challenges because it wasn't  there was no precedent  we hadn't done things like this in the past  um  so we had to work to like motivate people within ourselves to go out and get people to register and participate and things like that. Um  and there's also of course the challenge of then finding others. Um  give us five dollars to participate in our event  why it's of any value  why it matters. And so that duality was really a challenge  as well as of course working amongst ourselves  and so we met those by really laying out very concrete goals  um  and like  doing a lot of brainstorming among the five of us  breaking up  um  to focus on different elements of the problems we would face. Um  and the event ended up being really tremendously successful and then we had a lot of people participate. We met those goals of participation and money raised um  and then were able to have the event again this year and really set a precedent that hadn't existed before  so  it was very successful.|Interviewer: That's very excellent. So uh  what's your greatest weakness? If you had to change one thing about yourself  what would that be?|Interviewee: Um  so I think currently  um  what my greatest weakness  and one which I'm working on  is my ability  I talked a lot just now about leadership positions and so they definitely impact me a lot. Right now my ability to successfully delegate  um and the word  I'm not necessarily looking for the word micro-manage  but just truly delegate responsibility  work with another person  and let them be very responsible and communicate with them. I think i struggle there and that's definitely a weakness in my leadership as well as just my general activities because i struggle just to let that person kind of go and foster their own ideas and get their own job done. I'm very quick to step in and assist maybe step on their toes even or at least provide feedback. Sometimes it is warranted and sometimes I think it isn't  and so to be more cognizant of that and to uh be better adept to deal with that I think would be very helpful. And so  I'd love to see that change. It is something I'm working towards and I'm working with people whose leadership I admire  um  who I think do a better job of that then me and try and model myself after them  but currently I do think it's a weakness that I'd like to improve.|Interviewer: So  think of a job you'd like to have.|Interviewee: Okay.|Interviewer: Got one?|Interviewee: Yes.|Interviewer: So now  why do you think you deserve this job?|Interviewee: So  for this particular job  um  I think my greatest assets are the combination of skills and experiences that I bring to the table. Um and I think that it'd be very valuable for the position. So I have a very strong technical background  I'm in my third year at MIT studying chemical biological engineering which requires a wide array of very challenging coursework. Um  and I've done research in the field as well  so all of those skills combine to give me a strong technical set of both problem solving and engineering based skills. And then I also have done a lot of work outside of the classroom  both in projects that are academic related and totally not  community services related and things of that nature  um truly develop communication skills  organization skills  um  and the ability to really take a project and get it done. And so I think for this position I will have the technical background to fully understand and wrap my mind around and make goals that I want to accomplish just solve a problem and then these other skills will ensure that not only can I identify a problem  but if I identify a problem I will get it done and I know how to facilitate whatever resources that are available to me to ensure that whatever job gets done well  so I think that will make me a very strong candidate.|Interviewer: Well thank you  thanks for your time.",

I\u2019m a junior and I\u2019m really interested in building robots to use in the ocean.  Like  this summer I worked on an underwater vehicle to look at sea ice in Antarctica.  |Interviewer: Great.  Um  do you think you\u2019re a leader?  Tell me why.|Interviewee: Yes  I believe I\u2019m a leader.  Right now  um  one of my main leadership initiatives is restarting the Society of Naval Architects Submarine Engineers at MIT.  And that\u2019s a group of all the ocean engineers studying at MIT including undergrads and grad-students.  And  um  I\u2019m working with other students to organize dinners with professors and outings with  with students interested in engineering from other schools and departments.|Interviewer: Do you consider yourself a team player?  Can you give me an example of a time when there was a conflict on your team that you had to resolve?|Interviewee: Yes  I\u2019d say I\u2019m a team player.  Uhm  this  this term I\u2019m working on a team for one of my classes. A team of about seven people and we\u2019re building  er  manufacturing a hundred yo-yos together and  um  it\u2019s actually complicated to manufacture one yo-yo if you\u2019re doing everything from scratch like the molds  the plastic  the process times  you figuring out which missions you want to use.  And  um  we\u2019ve done a yo-yo  we decided to divide our team into  um  groups of two people and each set of two people works on one part of the yo-yo so we have four parts.  And we were having a problem just last week when we needed to fill out a report about our yo-yos but two teams hadn\u2019t finished their part yet because they couldn\u2019t  um  get time in the mission shop  so we decided to resolve that by  we talked to the professor  I was the person who talked to the professor and asked for an extension on the report and told him what was happening.  Uhm  we got the extention  and anyway  if we wrote the report except missing the information from those two parts and then  the team working on those two parts is going to fill it in this week.|Interviewer: Okay. If you were given the option to change one thing about yourself what would it be?|Interviewee: Let\u2019s see.  Sometimes  I would like to be more comfortable with my voice.  Like speaking louder and more confidently.  |Interviewer: Mmm.|Interviewee: Sometimes  like when I go back home I pick up this southern accent again.  My family lives in D.C.  but a lot are from the south and they speak with the twang so when I came home for Thanksgiving I had this southern twang.  Oh  it sounded different and people were a little bit confused and then I went into this middle stage  now I\u2019m back to where I am now.  Maybe speaking a little bit more quieter  but without the accent.  So I need to find out where my voice is.  |Interviewer: Okay.  So  why do you think you should get the job?  |Interviewee: Uhm  I am a really hard worker  I\u2019m very organized  I\u2019m comfortable working with teams.  I\u2019m also on a sealing team which is another part of a team that I\u2019m involved on.  Um  I\u2019m passionate about what I do and I can bring a lot of engineering expertise and knowledge into the group.",

        "Transcript": "Interviewer: So  can you tell me a little bit more about your background?|Interviewee: Um  I'm a junior at MIT studying electrical engineering and computer science.|Interviewer: Okay.|Um  I first became interested in engineering in high school when I did a summer internship at a lab at materials science lab at UC Berkley  and since then I've taken  uh  several courses related to circuits and other eletrical engineering topics. And worked at  uh  electrical engineering labs at Standford and MIT. And  I've also worked in places like Promex Industries  which is a chip packaging company in the Silicon Valley.|Interviewer: Okay. So. Do you think you're a leader and tell me why?|Interviewee: Uh  yes. I've had several experiences where I've had to innovate and work with  take charge of a project and work with other people. For instance  I'm part of the MIT SAE team  and basically it's a club that builds a race car every year.|Interviewer: Oh wow  okay.|Interviewee: Um  and  as of  so  we need a lot of money for sponsorship. But  as of the end of last year  the website was pretty much defunct. So  I decided to take over as webmaster and one of my  and  over the summer and the beginning of the school year. I set up a new one that's nicely designed  and to get it up  I had to work with most of the other sub-team leaders to get information that I needed. For instance  the specs of the car  pictures of the car  different events for PR and things like that. And  it's done now  so it's online now.|Interviewer: Great. Alright. Do you consider yourself a team player  and can you give me an example of a time there was a conflict in your team that you had to resolve.|Interviewee: Um. So. Ah yes because. Uh  for instance  I'm also on the (inaudible). And  um  while I was working on designing the website I talked to several other people including the public relations chair about how to design and present ourselves on the website. And  we disagreed about certain  uh  about the layout and things like that. So to resolve the issue  we basically looked at websites of several other successful teams and tried to  we basically both compromised to try to emulate things that seemed to work well for other people. And  we also got opinions from several other team members.|Interviewer: Okay. If you were given an option to change one thing about yourself  what would it be?|Interviewee: Um  one thing right now is that  I get hung up on small details on a project. And  that could be an issue when I'm working on a big project  it can take too much time to focus on little things that don't matter too much in the big picture. But  I'm working on changing that so since I've come to MIT I've been involved in a lot of activities and a lot of classes  and this is forcing me to manage my time well so I've gotten better at focusing on the big picture of the project rather than small details that don't matter very much.|Interviewer: Great. Why do you think you should get the job?|Interviewee: I have the quantitative and qualitative skills to solve problems and get things done  and  I'm really interested in this position and I think I can learn and grow from it.|Interviewer: Great.",

        "Transcript": "Interviewer: So uh.. please tell me about your background.|Interviewee: Hah.. uh yeah..so.. uhm I'm chase and I guess uh. Aww man okay so  i've done web development for a long time  I started in abotu 8th grade and actually started making a few sites just back then and for the heck of it and uhm just started making some money through them sold a website through them which was great. Uhm and through all fo this I got an internship for my sophmore year of high school  which was awesome. It was through a job search website called indeed and over there I did a ton of different stuff and from internationalization  I was one of the first people to start the internationalization forum for indeed  and so they've now expanded to four countries and I think  the international traffic revenue is like 30% of their company now. They also just got sold for like a billion dollars uh I believe..about three weeks ago or something which was really cool. But at the same time I don't really want to work there anymore  because they have been sold and I don't really know the owner anymore where as I did previously and that was great where I don't know  otherwise  coming to MITF you know had aphenomenal blast up there. I had been studying computer science..uhm really enjoyed it and spent a lot of time on a lot of various side projects and just ahnging out with people so like  I don't know  making really cool robotics stuff... uhm like  cool educational software.. uhm some kinnect tax and different things like this.|Interviewer: That sounds really interesting. Do you think you're a leader? Tell me why.|Interviewee: Uhm..I would I..I would go this.. I I would say there is kind of uhm from two standpoints both from high school and from college  in high school I was the captain of our ultimate frisbee team..uhm and so I started it in my junior year and just got all my friends  because we used to play frisbee all with each other and I said hey  why don't we start competing and make this happen liek three times a week or soemthing and so we went ahead and did this and uhm.. uh started practicing enough and I had to make sure that everything was coordinated and that people actually came to practices  I mean you like had to have everyone come and everything otherwise no one is going to wanna play or there is going to be no ability to play basically.. so uhm we  played enough so that we were actually able to get 3rd in uhm well actually 3rd in my senior year  5th my junior year and uh in the state of texas in frisbee which is uh impressive without a coach. Uh  otherwise I was also the captain of the crosscountry team and uhm  uh captain of uhm uh the track team as well  so uhm that um roles been more minimal  more of an inspirational role like make sure you come to practice sort of thing. of stuff and uhm in college here I've been working with a group called saftey fp and uh  which promotes student wellness around campus  sounds like you've heard of it. uhm and yeah  so just making sure we have awesome events that happen  I just recently read an event called super smash bros turned in which was really great  uhm..I don't know anything about super smash bros  so... I had to actually go get the the other people that knew a lot about it and made sure they told all their friends about it  and got them to actually figure out the whole thing the whole logistics and that wa sme just getting them excited about it  and and convinced them to get a lot of people to come.|Interviewer: So uhm thinking about all those teams  and where you were a team player. Tell me about a time when there was conflict in your team and you had to resolve it. |Interviewee: Uhm okay definitely I enjoy teams like no other  I'm at MIT specifically  I go out of my way to like  working in teams and in any different aspect and for the most part  I've had really great teams in general  but uhm just this semester  I'm actually working on a start up with a friend  so he's been working on it a while and he's just such an awesome guy  that I was just like Oh  i want to build stuff for you so  I am kind of doing contract work for him  we are just hacking together all the time  really just like  there are no conflicts there frankly but I find but otherwise for my year off  for my reasearch that I'm doing here for MIT  uhm i had previously uh a research postion  at uh my freshman year  uhm but I did not really like it that much because  I had to do it by myself because it was an android thing  I mean I don't know I feel like I can always do stuff by myself  it does not have to be in a group  but now actually i just tell all my friends  if they hear about an opp they should just invite me to do it with you  because I would just love to do a year off with someone because like  I'd love to have someone that I like to working with and to work on the same product would make everything so much better  so like my friend does this cool photography and I just do the tech thing  it is fun  but in terms of conflicts I've had  uhm I feel like conflicts are a general minimal for the uhm the most part that I have found  it's most like  who is going to do what  uhm and in these cases uhm and for the most part and uhm i'm pretty flexible basically  that's how I just go around stuff and just try and explain everything very well  to everyone just to make sure everyone knows exactly what is going on and just reinterating all this to everyone so that  *cough cough* at least then so everyone is on the same page. Because for the most part people generally care to be fair but you just have to describe to everyone how they understand things.|Interviewer: Interesting  some of that is interesting  so if you were given an option to change one thing about yourself  what would that be?|Interviewee: Uhm  okay so I would   something I woudl change about myself  okay so that's interesting  uhm oh okay I would almost  uhm  heh  uhm..the dumb answer to this would be that I woudl like to be a bit taller  i think that would always help. Uhm but I think I can also interpret this question on what would I like to work on..or what am I working on.|Interviewer: Fair enough.|Interviewee: And like in thsi case  i would definitely go for uhm actually my ability to  speak ah hah and uhm just in general and uh like I find for now for example  like how I kind of seem like I understand what I'm tlaking about for exmample  for the most part  I  *mumbles* everynow and then but uhm what I'm actually thinking about harder problems and I'm trying to explain myself where I just worked on a hard problem I only looked at once so I don't fully understand everything  for the most part I get it in my head but when I try and explain it to someone  i it's actually pretty hard to me. And to uhm..everything in an uhm I guess interesting manner  well almost and kind of say it once instead of say something and then which is what I do freqently and then I say oh wait that does not make sense  let me try another avenue. I just keep trying different avanues until the other person gets it  but I would love to be able to just give it that first time  I can just think for a second and say okay this is exactly what I need to say. Use the vocabulary words I need to use  which frankly I'm not that good at  and in terms of expanding my vocabulary and expanding my words for whatever like dictionary or see I don't even know the word  like my expanse of the vocabulary that exists in my head and uh on an given and at any given time  not as large as it should be. |Interviewer: So uh  give about all we talked about today  thanks again for sharing   why do you think  why do you think you should get this job?|Interviewee: Uhm  So I know  I.. I would say it just comes down to the passion for the most part  I just really enjoy anything that I am working on  if I am ever going to pck something to work on  i bascially just go at it full force  I always tlak to my friends about it  it's always on my mind in the shower  it's like always in the top of my mind  I am working on a problem and I have to get that problem finished  and I basically  I never really feel like suffer from burn out  that may be because I haven't worked on soemthing enough uhm but uhm  for the msot part  i really enjoy working on stuff and I just  it's my passion and my passion is actually just like working  when i get tired of working  i work on something else  it's actually a relaxing state  like if I am working here for example  I do hard in all my classes  I just start programming. I feel in a great place  I'm either working out or working on soemthing  I I I I think your company woudl love to see someone like that.|Interviewer: Thanks Chase  I apprec.",

Um  I guess  to start with the basics  I'm uh  a junior at MIT right now. I'm studying course six three  it's computer science. And uh  I guess I didn't really get into computer science until last year. And um  that's after I transferred here from the University of Michigan. And then uh  since then pretty much everything I do has been computer science. |Interviewer: No  awesome. Our courses department is pretty excellent here.|Interviewee: Yeah.|Interviewer: So uh  tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership.|Interviewee: All right  um  so this past um  this past summer um  I uh  got  well I guess last year  I got involved with an organization on campus called Camp Kasim.|Interviewer: Uh-hmm.|Interviewee: And so  Camp Kasim runs a camp for the children of cancer patients. And it's um  it's kind of a therapeutic camp  so the aim is for kids to just have fun. And  anyway  we have various units that we break the kids up into to  that are divided up by age. And um  I wasn't the unit leader for my unit but uh  there was a time when our unit leader had to go off and uh  it was either his break or he had to uh  go off and take care of some other stuff. And so  uh  I was kind of given control of the unit. And so um  it was an interesting experience  because we were dealing with kids. But um  obviously the counselors were adults and college students  my peers.|So um  there's this kind of flip flopping between interacting with my peers and like  making sure they were on top of their um  you know  their jobs as counselors. Watching the kids and making sure the kids are having fun. Also  like  playing around with the kids and making sure the kids are like  not thinking about anything  but having  but having a good time. So um  this kind of  I just like  should that answer the question?|Interviewer: Yeah. Yeah  I think so  it's always import to help the problem. Uh  so tell me about a time when you were on a team and you faced a challenge. How did you overcome the problem?|Interviewee: All right um  so in  I guess  the last time I can really remember being part of uh  really intense team experience was um  in high school  I was on the year book as a photographer. So um  we  I  my friend and I were both the head photographers. So we  organized all the photos. And so  we would coordinate with the editors. And um  in that they would tell us what sort of content we needed  like what events needed to have photos taken of them  or what teams needed photos. And  we would go about organizing the actual um  like the sending of the photographers to go to these events or to get the team photos. And  so um  there we times when  like just getting  making sure that our photographers got to events uh  and like  and end up getting a decent amount of good photos um  was  could be very challenging. Because  I mean  because we were all very busy students. And so um  one  like just  I guess one challenge we faced was just getting people to like  really commit to their job and follow through on that. And so  part of what we did was just try to build a really strong like  team culture. And  a sense of like  comradery among the photographers themselves. |Interviewer: Ah  yes. |Interviewee: Um  you know  try to get people to um  like try to get people to go to event  even though  and they weren't assigned. Just out of  like the eagerness to take photos and photography. And so  um  we kind of approached this challenge and motivated  it was like it was sort of a challenge in motivating our  our um  peers. And so  um  or like incentivizing these photos. And  we approached by trying to  like build a sense of community and uh  like  like  and like and ambition in terms of like taking photos. Um  it was  it ended up playing out very well  but there's still a couple photographers who just  you know. |Interviewer: Yeah. |Interviewee: They just didn't want to do the job  sometimes. I mean  they  they usually had like  valid  some what valid excuses  but. |Interviewer: That inevitable. |Interviewee: Yeah  but yeah this job still need to get done. So uh  yeah  I mean  that was uh  pretty interesting team experience. |Interviewer: That went well. So  can you tell me about one of your weaknesses and what your doing to overcome it?|Interviewee: Sure  um  yes. Let's see  um  maybe one of my  I'd say one of my weaknesses is communicating my thoughts clearly. Uh  at times I struggle to uh  I struggle to quickly come up with a sentence or phrase to describe what I'm thinking. And so  I like  I find myself kind of slowly articulating a sentence. And um  there's some situations were  just like that those pauses and that slow thinking or slow articulation is uh  can be problematic. And in other  in other situations  like the slow thinking ends up being some what useful  because I've  you know  I don't say anything  I don't tend to say anything rash. And so  um  it has it's merits. But usually  its just in general  it's nicer just to have a faster pace so  in kind of like conveying thoughts. |Interviewer: So  now thinking back to the job that we talked about  now why do you think we should hire you?|Interviewee: Um  um  so I'd say that I'm committed  hard working  uh  person. And  in terms of this job I guess  uh  and my edge  can I describe what it is?|Interviewer: Sure.|Interviewee: All right  so in my head it's a software engineering position and so  I believe as um  I can contribute a lot to this  with the skills that I've gained here at uh  MIT. And  then also  I believe that I can gain a lot from the company  in terms of learning um  about what they do and how they do it. And  I think it would be a good partnership. |Interviewer: Well  thank you. For coming to your interview today.",

        "Transcript": "Interviewer:  Please tell me a little bit more about your background.|Interviewee:  Umm  so I'm a Junior at MIT  umm studying economics  umm and planning on minoring in biology  perhaps concentrating in anthropology.  Umm  I'm interested in pursuing a degree in Public Health after  right after MIT  umm and either waiting to do an MD  or combining those two at the same time.  Umm  what I'm really interested is health care disparities  umm especially in  in the field of international health  umm specifically kind of doing uh cost evaluation of different health projects  umm working towards  uh figuring out how resources can best be allocated  and best be used to maximize efficiency.  Umm  and then here at MIT I'm also involved in an organization called Glommid  umm and we  what we do is we're partnered with an organization in Togo  umm and they work with HIV/AIDS patients there and they are the primary HIV/AID care provider  umm  outside of the public health system there.  Umm  and so what we do is we fundraise for them throughout the year and then in the summer we go and implement a project there.|Interviewer:  Oh  ok great.  And do you think you are a leader?  Tell me more.|Interviewee:  Umm  I think that definitely over the MIT  my MIT career  I've evolved more as a leader.|Interviewer: Ok.|Interviewee:  Umm  of the  umm actually the co-president of Glommid  umm last year  so the club started last year  uh  but the presidents were not very invested in the club  umm  and what I learned from that was I guess  the experience was  taught me some things what leaders shouldn't be  but I think really I've learned whats effective as a leader so far  by doing things differently this semester.  Um  some of the things like even just the really little basic things seem to really have an impact  so for example  for our staff meetings which is the whole general body meeting  umm we're sending  we send out a little doodle form beforehand and it kinda just has  you know what concerns do you have  umm do you feel like you're really involved  like umm  and there's also just a little section  like kudos to someone for doing a great job this week.  And just having that  like interaction and then also we like follow up on any concerns  umm I think the members really have liked that  and so far compared to last year everyone like even the people who are just general body members not even like an exec are much more invested than some of the exec members last year and I think thats because we realized last year what we really were lacking  umm  like my current co-president realized that what we were lacking was really a sense of community and in order to be effective and to really establish a strong relationship with our partner and to fundraise and really come up with a strong project  we need to focus within ourselves first.  Umm  so that experience definitely has taught me a lot about leadership.|Interviewer:  Great  ok.  Do you consider yourself a team player  and can you give me an example of when there was a conflict within your team and you had to resolve it?|Interviewee:  Umm  yea ok.  So  conflict.  Umm  well i guess I'll use an example from last year for Glommid.  Umm  so we were partnered with a different organization last year  and we  what  how it works is a national organization  theres fifty chapters  umm and we had a partner in Laos  and all of a sudden last minute  they said we could no longer go and implement the project.  So I was the person in charge of organizing the trip  that my role on exec  so that was really hard for me because I felt kind of betrayed kind of by the co-presidents and by nationals umm  because the reason was because the Laotian government would see us volunteer tourism and they could get their NGO status revoked since Laos just started having NGO's.  So that was something I kind of was unsure about like are we sure we can go here  like Laos is very not welcoming towards Americans because of  past.  And so  I felt really kind of let down by umm  by them.  And I think everyone on the Glommid team also felt really let down  because it was February  we had been fundraising all year  planning campaigns  umm and this  so what we did I think  umm  like I switched over to campaigns coordinator and I still like tried to keep everyone invested and excited for our campaign to still fundraise for them  because it wasn't because they were a bad organization that we couldn't go  it was because that the government wouldn't allow it  and we didn't want to risk them losing their NGO status for a project.  Umm  so what  I  went through the campaign  I tried to get people to focus more  just remember what our partner does  why we are doing this  umm and not focus so much on kind of the miscommunication that happened between nationals and the partner organization.  Umm  and then through this summer  and through this fall i've been trying to keep in contact with our partner  our old partner  although we are repartnered now  umm  to see how our  the money we raised like how that project is going and to try and keep people informed about what's going on  so that it doesn't feel like last year was a complete failure.|Interviewer:  Ok.  |Interviewee:  Yea.|Interviewer:  Great.  And if you were given an option to change one thing about yourself what would it be?|Interviewee:  Oh  thats a tough question.  Umm  I think sometimes i can lack a bit of confidence in bigger group settings.  Umm  and it usually takes me a little bit to get comfortable with the situation  so I think  I've definitely  and this is something i've been working on to be more proactive and in larger group situations  but for example like big lectures  asking questions or things like that I usually try and avoid  but I've been trying to push myself to become more vocal.|Interviewer:  Great.  And last question  why do you think you should get the job?|Interviewee:  Uh  I think I should get the job because I think what my assets are I combine Econ and health  which is kind of rare to have as an undergraduate to have this combination.  And I've done  I've taken a lot of classes  I'm involved in a national development  both from the technical side of Econ  the anthropological and the health side.  And also my involvement in Glommid has also taught me a lot about the realities of international health and international development that I don't think necessarily come through a class.|Interviewer:  Great!",

Yeah I\u2019m in Zeta Psy fraternity and uh yeah so  yeah  right above Chicago Pizza. And uh yeah do you want me to go into more detail  or just general? Yeah  um yeah so I uh I don\u2019t too much as far as extra-curricular but I was involved with Frisbee freshman year for a little bit and played the club team  there\u2019s not a varsity team here. I was pretty good  liked that a lot. And uh I\u2019m not sure as far as career wise what I want to go into but as a physics major I\u2019m looking into something technical probably electrical engineering related. Uh and yeah but I\u2019m trying to size that up right now. Junior\u2019s a pretty pivotal year for you know deciding long term things. Yeah so brief summary of me.|Interviewer: Good so tell me a time when you demonstrated leadership.|Interviewee: Um well high school uh senior year probably the best time. I helped organize a math competition um so there was no major middle school math competition in Pensacola  Florida and so I just teamed up with a few people with my year in high school and we helped organize a competition. It\u2019s been going on for the past three years and uh hopefully it\u2019ll go further. That was one of the most stressful things but the most rewarding as well and yeah so as far as leadership goes. I mean more recently I guess juggling club has been my main leadership thing  we organize different gigs and perform various places so.|Interviewer: So uh tell a time when you were working in a team and you faced a challenge. How did you go about solving it?|Interviewee: Um so that would most commonly have been this past semester  I took junior lab which is the physics lab class. Lots of challenges frequently. It was me and a partner who worked on three different experiments and um specifically I guess let me think because yeah we had three major experiments and the second experiment was very hands on which was cool but it also means there was a lot of faulty equipment. I guess just a general thing we both learned to kind of talk it through because it\u2019s so easy to I don\u2019t know get like get in your head and you\u2019re working with somebody so they\u2019ll be thinking one thing and you\u2019ll be thinking another. Yeah I guess that\u2019s not very specific but I mean yeah that\u2019s the first thing that came to mind so.|Interviewer: Thank you. Can you tell me about one of your weaknesses and what you\u2019re doing to overcome it?|Interviewee: Yeah weakness? I guess I uh as far as this is kind of a general thing that I\u2019ve kind of come to the realization of recently. I need to um I don\u2019t know I\u2019ve been kind of getting along with my undergraduate career and you know what I\u2019ll do after. Self-advocacy is like a huge thing and I haven\u2019t really gotten too much into that but I feel like a major thing for like taking the next step like after graduation is like self-advocacy. Whether it\u2019s like having your own website or just like general networking. I don\u2019t know that\u2019s something that I realize that I need to kind of work on.|Interviewer: Okay thank you that was important. So now think about a job that you\u2019d like to have. Okay do you have one in mind?|Interviewee: Um yeah.|Interviewer: Good okay  so now why do you think you should have this job?|Interviewee: Why do I think I should have this job?|Interviewer: Yes.|Interviewee: Um I feel like I\u2019m a pretty creative person and you know having a bit of technical background here and a good work ethic I feel like I really do have those strengths. Yeah I feel like I communicate pretty well for um  I\u2019m not saying you know general physics majors can\u2019t communicate well  just in general I feel like especially this past semester I\u2019ve taken a lab classes I\u2019ve been able to give a lot of oral presentations and um I kind of found a strength there and so I think kind of bringing a solid communication element to a technical field is pretty important. So um yeah I feel I\u2019m pretty qualified there.|Interviewer: Thank you.",

        "Transcript": "Interviewer: So  please tell me about yourself.|Interviewee: So my name is Fernando Iber  I am a junior here  I come from Puerto Rico  and I am currently studying biological engineering. Uh  I\u2019m considering doing pre-medicine  maybe going into either an MD  and  let\u2019s say  apply to some schools as an MD  or go into an MD-PHD program. Um  my main interest is basically oncology  but  like  I  over the past few years I\u2019m doing a couple of research programs  I did an internship  and it basically  like  gave me a view that I could tackle that problem in a lot of ways. So not just being a clinician  but being a researcher  a medical researcher.|Interviewer: Oh  yes.|Interviewee: So that\u2019s how I got interested into the whole MD-PHD thing  and  like  I\u2019ve gotten a hold of some programs that I viewed  and there\u2019s a lot out there. I couldn\u2019t have imagined that if I stayed home. It\u2019s amazing what people do here. |Interviewer: Most definitely. So can you tell me about a time when you demonstrated leadership?|Interviewee: So I\u2019m  I\u2019m pretty involved in  in campus groups. Uh  I was the first founder of  of their restructuring of Beta Theta Pi  so I\u2019m currently  you would say  chapter president. Uh  so I\u2019m leading the whole  the whole cavalry of recruitment right here on campus  and we\u2019re getting a lot of results. Um  I\u2019m also in the Board of Puerto Rican students  I serve as social chair  and I am also pretty involved in dorm government  especially rec-CBW planning  so I just like to get around. So any  anything that gives me that type of opportunity to just explore  any guise is all pretty good for me. Uh  I was also considering something for soccer  uh  in terms of being team treasurer  but unfortunately I had a bit of an accident with my leg  so I got out of soccer. |Interviewer: Sorry to hear that. So  can you tell me about a time when you were working on a team  and you faced a challenge  how did you solve the problem?|Interviewee: So  I actually have a really humbling experience. Last semester I took a class about mechanics. A lot of people in that class were juniors and I was a sophomore. So everybody there was much more experienced than me  so I was the only sophomore in my group  there were two ones that were juniors  and it was the final project. And when we sat down and started talking about things to do  I basically had almost no knowledge of the things they were planning  \u2018cause they already took cell biology  and they took really advanced courses in fluid dynamics  and they were trying to do some tissue modeling. Like  even though it was a class about mechanics  and I could understand some of the things  I had absolutely no idea what I was doing. And they just put me there  and one of them was really helpful  and actually guided me through the initial process  but the other one was not available at all  at any time. So I basically had to sit down  I actually met with the professor a couple of times  just to  like  talk and chat  and we took the professor out for  for a lunch  so we could just  like  talk about stuff  and I actually had to find out my own way through everything  with a little help of the only junior friend that was actually available to me. And it was humbling because normally when I worked on teams  we were all pretty equal  equal minded  or it was in a humanities class. \u2018Cause normally technical classes here don\u2019t have much to do with team projects in sophomore year. Normally laboratories and final design project classes are for older students  so it was a surprise for me where it came  like  I\u2019m a sophomore  and I\u2019m already doing final presentations for bio-mechanics. And it just caught me pretty off guard. And the only way\u2026we ended up doing an extremely awesome project  but it took lots of coffee  Red Bull  and Wikipedia. That\u2019s my strategy for now  \u2018cause it was completely new territory right there  compared to humanities or any other classes where you\u2019re  everybody has the same mindset. So that was my group trauma. |Interviewer: So  uh  tell me about one of your weaknesses and what you\u2019ve done to overcome it. |Interviewee: So I didn\u2019t have any actually trouble self-recognizing trouble about  so stemming off of  from the inexperience type of situation  that was actually the first group project I had where that experience happened  and I feel like if I get into something that I don\u2019t  basically  know  I have a really hard time finding stuff out for myself. So if I don\u2019t come prepared to do something  it takes me a while to get to a pace to actually start absorbing material and actually contributing  which is kind of a handicap  because some students are already up to speed and they already expect some things from me. And I  I  I obviously would like to give them my all and hand out everything they want on a silver platter  but it\u2019s hard for me. So I\u2019ve been trying  so basically  like  the solution for me was basically studying more  putting much more effort from my part  but it\u2019s still a big  a big minus in my  in my turf. It\u2019s  uh  it takes me a while to dominate things that  that I don\u2019t have an up-to-speed inclination to that. And that has caused  like  mishaps that  well  through hard work you can overcome them  but a lot of work  compared to your regular person. |Interviewer: Excellent  thank you. Um  so I guess my last question is  thinking of a job that you\u2019d like to have- do you have one in mind?|Interviewee: Yeah.|Interviewer: So now  why do you think we should hire you?|Interviewee: So I feel like  even though I\u2019ve gone through many obstacles  I\u2019ve always tried and found a way to excel  exert myself to bigger than I\u2019d previously thought. So I might sometimes feel that I don\u2019t have that knowledge on me  but I will go out and get it  even if it takes a lot of coffee or a lot of effort  because there\u2019s also a sense of satisfaction in actually giving it more than you can  but seeing that actually succeed. You know what I mean? It\u2019s  uh  it\u2019s like what MIT does to you  you\u2019re humbled by an immense amount of work  you\u2019re humbled by  by extremely hard classes that you had no idea that they were going to come and blast you with pieces  homework  and exams that you are overwhelmed. But you sit down  you think about stuff. I sit down and I think about stuff  and I get a plan there. That  the good thing about the plan  it takes some time to devise a plan  because it  it\u2019s not as efficient  it\u2019s not efficient to go randomly guessing what to do  but  but  having  like an educated guess  you remember the SAT\u2019s  where it\u2019s like \u201cyou may not always know the answer  but you can make an educated guess as to what the answer may be.\u201d So that\u2019s how I approach things when I have no idea what I\u2019m doing  but after some effort it will actually get me to a place where I can say \u201chey  I\u2019m here  let\u2019s get crackin\u2019.\u201d Um  that\u2019s sort of  like  the general mindset I have for many problems  be it the life sciences  you have to do an essay  if I have to come up with elucidating a mechanism that does this to breast cancer cells  or if I go by  the walks of life can take you anywhere  if I end up being a consultant for a  for Johnson and Johnson  let's say  a company for random purposes  and  it's the same way you tackle every problem. You get up and you find out what you have a hard time doing  then you sit down and do it. Uh  sometimes it's frustrating  because results don't come out like this  um  but I feel like once you get the hang of it  you can start  your productivity increases by x-fold  x be a number  much higher than one  let's talk MIT here. Yeah  I feel that's the  that's at least my way of tackling things and it's gotten me through a lot  and it's actually helped me wear down the walls of MIT and have a better experience at it  so I feel it's the same way I should attack all the problems that come to me. |Interviewer: Oh  well thank you.

        "Transcript": "Interviewer: How are you doing today?|Interveiwee: Good  how are you?|Interviewer: Gooood  tell me about yourself.|Interviewee: So  umm I'm from Chicago... and I'm a junior here at MIT  umm when I came here I was pretty sure I wanted to do health related work  so I guess I came in as a biology major. And my dad is also a MDHP really interested - or really involved in research|Interviewer: Mhm.|Interviewee: Um  and so sort of that influenced me a lot. So then I realized  after doing biology for two years essentially  that I wasn't really enjoying it (laughs). And so  I decided to try out computer science. Because this is MIT after all and if I did want to do biology in the future  which it's not that I don't like biology  it's that I didn't feel like I was learning skills that would contribute to the field I guess. And so  um yeah.|Interviewer: Great.|Interviewee: So then I decided to do computer science. That's a very small part of me (laughs). That's a very broad question.|Interviewer: So tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership.|Interviewee: Um  so I am the co-president of an organization at MIT called Glo-Met  and what we do is  we're partnered with a non-profit gratitude organization abroad  so our group is basically non profit. We work with HIV health care work in Togo  and so I guess an example of leadership would be this whole semester I suppose  it's been a work in progress  it's the first time I've ever been like in a president's role in a group of about 30 people. And all the records are new this year  its a new organization. So it's sort of like realizing  you know there's so many aspects of leadership  it's not just like  not only the objectives your group needs to get done but also the camaraderie you have in a group and we can show that's being maintained properly. Um and we had a lot of really troublesome leadership experiences last year with this group. Um so I guess I've been learning a lot. Do you have specific questions about that?|Interviewer: No  I want to hear about your experience.|Interviewee: Okay. So yea in terms of like leading a group of people that are like you know  my age  umm and we're all like new at it  it's definitely a work in progress. But we do a number of things in terms of umm  we fund raise for... so we hold campaigns and we fund raise  in order to basically fund our projects abroad in Togo  so we are trying.. our main project right now is to improve the technological efficiencies of the clinic that we're partnered with in Togo  so we... it's hard sometimes motivating a group of people when your partner is abroad  it's not like  we haven't met them yet  and it's a new partnership  so we're traveling there this summer but since it's new its kind of as a leader I think it takes a lot of like  not only vision and fore planning but like also like you have to be able to step back and allow other leaders in your group to step up. You can't just do everything yourself.|Interviewer: Mhm.|Interviewee: Even if that seems easier. Umm and then also like  maintaining the motivation among a group of people that are like really busy with other things in their lives. So that's the biggest challenge I think  but.|Interviewer: Great. Tell me about a time you're working on a team a face a challenge  how do you solve that problem?|Interviewee: Umm... so I guess the same organization  we had a lot of umm  problems. Um  so  we are a team as an organization. So last year I was like a director on the exec board  but not umm one of the co-presidents  and the biggest challenge we've had as a team was that our co presidents were not motivated  had very poor communication  and we didn't have  we just didn't really get anything done. Umm so a challenge on my part was not really  I wasn't sure  I knew what needed to get done and I knew things like we needed to be more efficient and take more initiative and you know  motivate our staff  because it's not like  it's not just about us  we obviously  there are people that like depend on us.. and umm  the problem was like not stepping on their toes at the same time  while trying to.. trying to get them motivated but you know  telling  and I think a challenge was that they felt it was  they felt personally attacked when people criticize them. Or when people try to make suggestions for better things to do umm so I think solving that problem was more just stepping back and being like you can't do everything  if that person is the president you just have to let them do what they're gonna do and wait til your ends do your job right  but don't try to push  like you can't always push through things  sometimes you gotta just like go.|Interviewer: Mhm.|Interviewee: And like... and I guess that's... that did kind of solve the problem. I mean  I didn't solve the problem of like  things not getting done. But like I think realizing that actually helps a lot. Because it was just like banging your head against the wall. So.. yeah! (Laughs)|Interviewer: Can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what your doing to overcome it?|Interviewee: That's like also a weakness I guess.. I guess a weakness of mine would be that I am pretty umm.. Knowing how to step back and not umm.. basically not trying to do everything myself when it's definitely supposed to be a team effort  and that involves a lot of like trust in other people and their competency. So umm... definitely giving people the chance to do the job right. And sometimes you make second chances. So I think that's.. I might have a bad temper sometimes. That can be part of it (laughs). So yeah.|Interviewer: Okay. And why do you think we should hire you?|Interviewee: I think because I'm very motivated. And I have a lot of self initiative and I'm hard on myself  so that sometimes I expect highly of other people in the same way  and that can  I mean that is part of both the challenge and the weakness question that you've asked about  but I think that is umm good in  when you have a team of people and like you need somebody that umm is very meticulous about delegating things properly and making sure things are done at the right time. And somebody who really takes like  self responsibility for things. So.. I think if it's for like a project for example  like a small group project its like good to have someone that isn't shy to speak up in a group. And somebody that can sort of like organize the group to  to coordinate the group better. Like vocally. (Laughs)",

        "Transcript": "Interviewer: Um  please tell me about yourself.|Interviewee: Okay  um  my name's Evan  Evan Muray  I'm a junior here at MIT in computer science. I'm originally from Louisville Kentucky. And  uh  yeah I currently live across the river. I heard about this study through e-mail. So  thought I'd check it out.|Interviewer: So  I lived in Louisville.|Interviewee: You did?|Interviewer: Yeah.|Interviewee: Nice.|Interviewer: Anyway. So can you tell me about a time when you served as a leader?|Interviewee: A leader? Uh sure. Um. A good example of that would be uh some of my extra curricular work  activities  so I'm involved in uh two activities in general that showcase my leadership skills. One is Camp Kesem MIT which is a student organization here on campus at MIT uh each summer the organization puts on a summer camp for children who's parents have or have had cancer. Um  and I serve on the coordinator board for this organization. Um  in the past I was in charge of handling applications and contacting families of campers who'd would come to our camp and being in contact with them throughout the year  send them newsletters  send them updates  plan reunions for them. Uh this year I am in charge of asking the students on campus and getting students to apply to become counselors for our camp and (inaudible) with students  so I work as a coordinator I actually have a co-coordinator  we usually work in tandem. The other activity is dance troop. It's another student organization here at MIT  where we put on a show each year and dance  have some fun  it's a dance show  and I'm a choreography for that organization as well. I lead a dance  teach people some dance moves for some fun.|Interviewer: Oh  that's all very excellent.|Interviewee: Thanks.|Interviewer: So  can you tell me a time when you were working on a team and you faced a challenge  how did you solve the problem?|Interviewee: Sure  uh  I think a great example of that would be this past January  I participated in a web design competition here on campus  6470  I was on a team with my girlfriend and a mutual friend of ours. It's always different working in a group with your friends as opposed to just hanging out with them. There was a bit of conflict about how we wanted the website to go. We had different visions for how we wanted it to look  and I think for me the best way that I handled that was to sort of be willing to compromise because I think it's a very important skill and also just listening  active listening. I was listening to why she wanted to make certain changes to the website. And by doing that  um  I was able to uh figure out uh sort of like a common ground that we could work towards  I think we eventually did hit um and were able to move forward with this one conflict that I definitely remember because it was pretty big at the time but  I mean  we needed to get through it.|Interviewer: So tell me one of your greatest weaknesses and what you're doing to overcome it.|Interviewee: My greatest weakness... Hm. Okay. Uh. I'd say my  one of my bigger weaknesses is  uh  I'd say  probably uh  self-starting  actually. It's something I've been working  it's like my goal for this year  to work on. In the past I would do my classes  take my classes  and really just kind of do my schoolwork significantly outside of classes. If there's one thing I learned from being around all these amazing people here at MIT  is if you have an idea just go for it. It's very easy  especially here  there's resources to do so  and  it's something that I want to work on  I have some ideas for projects I want to start on my own. It's always been an issue for me to actually start on things and come up with ideas and really get started on certain projects. But  this  I plan on starting my own website and doing some ideas with that  and hopefully I will gain some more experience in computer sciences.|Interviewer: Excellent. So uh think of a job you'd like to get hired for  why do you think we should hire you?|Interviewee: Uh  I think one of my best qualities is the ability to really quickly  coming to MIT for example  I came to MIT with very little experience in the field computer science. Many of my past internships  I've been going to  I don't have much experience  but I pride myself in the sort of grasp ideas quickly and uh build on top of those and use those to build solutions to problems. I find that  uh  after doing some examples of a certain problem  or just playing around with it for a little bit  I can get to work on using that sort of technology. In the past couple internships  I've had to deal with new languages  new framework  and I think that definitely more then compensates for any experience I'm lacking.|Interviewer: Excellent. Thanks again for coming again.|Interviewee: No problem  thank you for having me.|Interviewer: Of course!",

        "Transcript": "Ready.|Interviewer: Ready.  So how are you doing today?|Interviewee:  Good  how are you?|Interviewer:  Good.  Tell me about yourself.|Interviewee:  So I\u2019m a junior in chemical engineering.  Im very interested in energy application so um from alternative energy to more traditional sources so basically oil fossil fuels.  Um and kind of optimizing that industry I think theres a lot of potential there so that\u2019s that\u2019s where my main interest is.|Interviewer:  great.  and can you tell me a time you demonstrated leadership?|Interviewee:  yeah.  Um so im uh vice president of corporalations (sp) for the society of woman engineers.  And um we just held in September a career fair banquet.  So we had a dinner for about 200 people following the career fair.  Um and its it\u2019s a huge event to organize in the sense that students need to be matched up with companies that suit their interest for dinner.  |Interviewer:  mmhmm|Interviewee:  so the goal is just to have kind of a relaxed networking event after you know the hecticness of the carrerr fair.|Interviewer:  uh huh|Interviewee:  and and to just give people a chance to talk.  Um and so so I was working with a committee of six people and which I was the leader of and um I think one thing that I I really did to make sure that the event went smoothly was delegate tasks very early on.  Um so one of the one of things that happened in the previous years when I was one of the team and not leading the|Interviewer:  uh huh|Interviewee:  team was it became very disorganized because we didn\u2019t know what the other tasks were what the other people were doing.|Interviewer:  Mmm.|Interviewee:  and in the end we ended up having to work throughout the event to keep things running smoothly and I wanted the team members to be able to sit down and have dinner as well.|Interviewer:  right|Interviewee: so in the end it ended up running very well  um  and um kind of we all got to have dinner to so that was awesome.|Interviewer:  great.  Tell me about a time you were working on a team and faced a challenge.  How did you solve that problem?|Interviewee: um  so one of our senior design or not our senior but one of our design classes within chemical engineering|Interviewer:  uh huh|Interviewee:  um asks us to design uh chemical plant in one of the uh software programs we use. um  and so it\u2019s a very big project|Interviewer:  uh huh|Interviewee:  but its very modular.  So you can have somebody working on distillation columns and somebody working on the (sp) separator. Um and so one of the challenges um within that um is making sure that everyone is keeping up with their um their part of the project.|Interviewer:  right|Interviewee:  and so one challenge that I faced with that project was making sure that one particular person was thou rally involved because um its a lot of work today and we cant really afford to have any anyone kind of  slacking off|Interviewer:  mmhmm|Interviewee: um so kind of to addrses that problem I sat down with him  had a conversation with him about it  you know we are all feeling kind of the strain of this project  the deadline is coming.  Um but um you know we cant have anyone sitting on the sidelines so what is it that you want to get more involved in or where do you think your skills are?  And it turned out that um he wasn\u2019t very um he wasn\u2019t very comfortable writing the code in the program.  |Interviewer:  Mmm|Interviewee:  So he didn\u2019t want to write bunky code and just have somebody else try to fix his work all the time but he was very tight with the teaching assistants and so he could funnel our questions through them and getr us some good answers um back from them so that we could keep going through the project so through that conversation we found a way for him to contribute|Interviewer:  Great.  Tell me about one of your weakness and what you are doing to overcome it?|Interviewee:  I think  um kind of within my personality|Interviewer:  Uh huh|Interviewee:  I hacve a lot of a lot of go go go and uh and  a lot of times I don\u2019t um  realize that waiting is the best option you know just letting certain events take their course um may in fact be the best option.  Um so kind of to give you a good example of this is um when I was trying to decide which internships um or which internship offerse to accept I kind of was very anxious to kind of pick one and go with it um and kinf of get started in meeting people |Interviewer:  Mmhmm |Interviewee:  In that company and figuring ouit what I wanted to do and um I think in that circumstance it would have been better after I had accepted an offer I I got other offers that I of course couldn\u2019t consider because I was already tied to one particular offer and in that circumstance it would have been better to wait to see how things panned out|Interviewer:  Uh huh |Interviewee:  And to just communicate with other people saying that you know I really do think that pushing the deadline is the best|Interviewer:  Uh huh |Interviewee:  Option in this circumstance.  So kind of this year now I definitely waited for everything to pan out before making a decision.  Um and it has worked out really well actually . I I was very tempted to give a response to one of the offers I received|Interviewer:  Uh huh|Interviewee: But over this last weekend I actually went to a conference um and it changed my mind.  Both companies that I was deciding between was at the conference|Interviewer:  Uh huh |Interviewee:  And talking to the representatives really helped me.  So im glad that I waited to you know hit the buttons|Interviewer:  -great.  And last question.  Why do you think we should hire you?|Interviewee:  -I think that I have a uh ability to contribute really well to the group so not just bringing the knowledge um or the skills that are|Interviewer:  Uh huh|Interviewee:  In your job description   but also kind of the enthusiasms. T he willingness to contribute my ideas to the|Interviewee:  Uh huh|Interviewee:  Discussion and um really emerge myself in whats going on would make me a stellar candidate I think|Interviewer:  great",

I\u2019m in my Junior year. I\u2019ve been studying the whole time.I\u2019ve been teaching last summer in the field. It was a start up in Venice Beach  California and I enjoyed it quite a bit.|Interviewer:  Great do you think you\u2019re a leader? Tell me why?|Interviewee: I think that I ca be a leader. I am definitely not one that tends to lead. I am perfectly happy to play a more supportive role  because in my experience especially here there are plenty of people who like to lead and leaders are not needed. That said if there\u2019s something that needs to be done and nobody is stepping up to do it that is something that I can and will adapt to|Interviewer: Great  do you consider yourself a team player and can you give me an example of where you were on a team and there was a conflict and you had to resolve it?|Interviewee: I would absolutely consider myself a team player. I care more about people than basically anything else. Conflict? I\u2019m sorry I am trying to think of a story.|Interviewer: That\u2019s all right  a class project or anything like that?|Interviewee: So to be honest I haven\u2019t experienced major conflicts in general. Honestly I think it is best to keep open terms of communication I that makes it so that you can\u2019t have a disaster happen. There can be minor disagreements but they never turn into big conflicts.|Interviewer: Okay and if you were given an option to change one thing about yourself what would it be?|Interviewee: I\u2019d be smarter  yeah obviously but  I think I would like to have a better capability to understand those sides of things. Sorry that sounds really weird. In general I do but for computer science or science specifically there\u2019s the part that I am really good at which is everything that has to do with languages and puzzle solving that\u2019s great. That\u2019s fun. I like it a lot. But then there is also the side that is a little bit more mathematical and that is something that I struggle with. They are definitely different things people are typically good at either one or the other but being good at both is a little less common and that would be really awesome.|Interviewer: Okay  and why do you think you should get the job?|Interviewee: Because I think I would do a great job for you guys. I care a lot about my work especially when it affects other people and I really like what this company is doing. It is something that I believe in.",

I'm looking for a job here.  And I grew up in South Dakota and little bit in Cambodia  grew up on a farm.  I really enjoy playing music and cooking.  Probably my two biggest hobbies.|Interviewer: Okay.  Tell me about a time when you demonstrated leadership.|Interviewee:  Well  when I was in high school I was the leader of my 4-H club and that involved leading meetings.  There were a lot of younger kids were involved and I helped them get involved in sewing competitions for example and  um  things where they could learn about nutrition.  Um  and showing their animals and learning about how to raise an animal well.  So that was a big leadership role and it was kind of difficult but I definitely learned a lot from it.|Interviewer: And tell me about a time you were working on a team and faced a challenge.  How did you solve it?|Interviewee: Um  I play music with some of my friends in some social settings.  We've played for a couple of weddings and it's sometimes difficult to coordinate|what we would like to play and how we'd like to practice and the styles of music that we'd like to play  um  and to do that properly you just need to communicate a lot  um  and you need to be willing to sometimes do the things that you really don't want to do.|Interviewer: And can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what you're doing to overcome it.|Interviewee:  One of my weaknesses is probably procrastination  same as a ton of people  I'm sure.  To overcome that I am trying to structure my time and I have a schedule so that Ill do one thing for an hour and one thing for the next hour so if I procrastinate for the whole hour then I feel bad.  So  the idea is to avoid that.  |Interviewer: Okay.  And why do you think we should hire you.|Interviewee:  I think that I am a strong  strong learner  definitely at whatever new skills since in web development there's always new technologies coming along.  I am quick at learning those and I really enjoy learning new things.  And I have a good base with my computer science degree from MIT so I know in general how to think about programming.",

I'm from Canada  but I grew up in South Florida because  you know  one day my parents just decided that it was too cold *interviewer laughs* so they literally just decided to pick up and move. Uhh  so I basically lived there my whole life until I decided to come here for school  and  you know  since then I've just been going through MIT... I'm trying to do a lot of pre-med things. I like to volunteer. Uhhh  you know  strong family values  things like that. So...|Interviewer: Great! Do you think you're a leader? Tell me why.|Interviewee: Yes. Because  umm  everything I try to do  I  you know  always try to do the best that I can  and  even if I'm not the best at it  that-- the effort  like that alone should be enough to sort of inspire somebody  even if they're better at it than I am  you know. I find that's inspiring  you know  seeing someone try  you know  and trying their hardest. And maybe they're not the best at it but  you know  the effort that they put into something  is sort of something to be looked high upon  so...|Interviewer: Okay  okay  and do you consider yourself a team player? Can you give me an example of a time there was a conflict in your team and you had to resolve it?|Interviewee: *hushed laughter* Umm  sure. Sooo  basically almost every night when you go home to problem set... You know  problems sets here are sort of designed to be group efforts  at least in chemical engineering they are  and often you and your group are working and you come to a crossroads  you know  part of the group thinks you should go one wan and part of the gorup things we should go another way. And  you know  kind of something that I've learned is that you can't shut down other people's ideas... Umm  so  I think something really important to do is... WE end up trying both ways  and maybe it takes us a little blt more effot  and maybe it takes us a little bit longer  but then we know for sure  like  you know  Okay  this way definitely didn't work  and you know maybe this way is the better way to go... but at least we didn't just  you know  diverge one way  and think like Oh  maybe we should have done it another way  so I think that's pretty important.| |Interviewer: If you were given the opportunity to change one thing about yourself  what would it be?|Interviewee: Umm  hmmm. I wish I was taller *both laugh*. You know  sometimes  I guess I always think that  you know  I'm right  and  you know  it takes people some convincing and I--I know I'm definitely not right all the time but I think that's kind of  you know  like  human nature  like  no-one ever wants to think that they're wrong   but  uhh  you know something I've learned here is |you're not always right  and everyone here is pretty smart  and they also have some really good ideas  and  it's really important to sort of take into account what others are thinking and  you know  that's just sort of the best way to progress  at least in our work here  it's... No-one could ever finish something  for example  the problem sets like I was talking about before  you can't finish a problem set by yourself. You need to get input from other people  and like  becoming open-minded was definitely  like  a challenge for me  but it's something that I've been working on  and something I think I've definitely got a lot better at since coming to MIT  at least  so...|Interviewer: And  why do you think you should get into medical school?|Interviewee: Heh  ha  because I've been working my but off *both laugh* Umm  you know  it's just something that I'm very passionate about. I'm really  not... I would do it for free  like I'm  you know people say they want to do medicine for the money  or you know  'cause it's a high-power career  but you know   it's the only type of thing... and... that I see myself being satisfied with in a long-term career. It's... I love being part of  like  the medical community right now  you know  if it's my work between being an EMT  working at the hospital... you know  working as a tech... These are all things that I would love and I would do. I'm happy to wake up in the morning and go do these things  and  you know  I wanna say it's like my burning passion like  it is  you know  my drive and  you know  I think that's probably the most important thing when you're looking for a candidate for medical school or for a job. Umm  it's knowing that  you know  they're not gonna  you know  one day decide that they don't wanna do this anymore  and they're not kind of like Yeah  I'm not sure if I wanna go to med school. It's like  no  I've been wanting to do this since I was like  nine years old  and every single thing I've done to work my way towards it... it's just made me fall in love with it even more.|Interviewer: Okay.",

Umm  and since then I've worked at a variety of different places including labs and at  uh  and in the industry including electrical engineering labs here  and at Standford  and umm Promex Industries  which is a chip packaging company in the silicon valley.|Interviewer: So  tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership.|Interviewee: Umm  in high school I was part of the school orchestra and I played bassoon. I was the principle bassoon there. So  that means I was in charge of the bassoon section. So basically  umm  I ran extra  I ran practices for  within our section outside of  uh   when the orchestra would get together and practice.|Interviewer: Mm Hm.|Interviewee: I coordinated that. I also  uh  set up events between the woodwind sections to  uh you know  so people would get to know each other and  you know  we could practice together and things like that.|Interviewer: Great. Ok. Tell me about time you were working on a team and faced a challenge. How did you solve that problem?|Interviewee: Umm  this past summer I worked in Spain. Umm  in operations research and I was part of a research group there. Umm  it was  so  we had  uh  within our team  it was  communicating with each other was the biggest challenge because my Spanish isn't so great and their English wasn't so great.|Interviewer: Mm hm.|Interviewee: So  umm  what we ended  we basically communicated through like  the papers  through the papers we read  umm  we  well  one thing that helped was  we both got  like everyone  they got better at speaking English  I got better at understanding them. I guess they got better at understanding my Spanish also. So  we were able to communicate by just  you know  talking really slowly  repeating everything a couple times. Umm  we also did a lot of technical things and so those were mostly related to technical papers and things like that. Those were written mostly in English  so that was  that wasn't so much of a problem for me...but...it made it  because they were working in the area already and I was new to the area  looking through these made it easier for me to understand what my role was  what I was supposed to do. Umm  things like that.|Interviewer: Ok  great.  Can you tell me about one of your weaknesses and what you were doing to overcome it?|Interviewee: umm  well  one thing right now is that I can get really hung up on small details and  uh  it becomes a problem because its  it can be distracting and cause me to lose sight of  like  the big picture. But since coming to M.I.T. I've been  I've been involved in a lot of classes  a lot of activites and things and that's forced me to manage my time better.  So  now that  uh  like  I have  because I have a lot of time constraints  I'm forced to finish a project or assignment or whatever  and I can't  I can't get caught up in  like  little things that don't ultimately make a big a difference. So  um  by being forced to manage my time more  I'm  uh  overcoming this problem.|Interviewer: Great  ok. So  why do you think we should hire you?|Interviewee: Well  I have the  I have the quantitative and qualitative skills necessary to accomplish  uh  accomplish project goals and get things done.

        "Transcript": "Interviewer: Okay  how are you doing today?|Interviewee: Good! How are you?|Interviewer: Good. Tell me more about your background.|Interviewee: Um  so  I'm a junior at MIT studying computer science and molecular biology. Um  most of my background is in biology. I did research for about a year and a half at a lab here at MIT  in just basic molecular biology. Um  but  I'm also involved in a couple student groups on campus. One of them  I was previously involved in MIT Fighting World Hunger  so we did a lot of charity work with local and international hunger issues and trying to learn more about the issues. And  right now I've devoted all of my time to a different organization called GlobeMed at MIT  and we basically  our partner is a nonprofit organization abroad and we do work to improve HIV healthcare services in Togo  which is in Africa. Most people don't know where that is  so.|Interviewer: Do you think you're a leader and tell me why.|Interviewee: I think  uh  if I'm not now I think I have the potential to be one. Um  I still consider myself immature as in  I'm still a student  but  I think I have been given a couple of leadership positions that I've grown a lot from  um  and I think if I was given  if I was put in a different situation I could adapt to it. Um  would you like an example of a...|Interviewer: That would be great.|Interviewee: Um  so  uh  I'm co-president of the organization I just mentioned  GlobeMed at MIT. And  we  uh  basically are in charge  me and my fellow co-president are in charge of about 30 other members. Um  and this involves a lot of coordination among teams that we have split. We've organized our organization into different teams and we've got like campaigns  which is like fundraising team  and we've got communications  is like publicity  finances  and community building  and these are all like split up  at the same time we also have to maintain contact with our partner organization abroad in Togo. Um  so we do a lot with like non-profit business as well as marketing but also sort of try to appeal to the undergraduate population in terms of fundraising but also awareness. So it's kind of  pretty multi faceted  I think I've done a lot in terms of building up this organization  it started from scratch essentially  so. And  if you wanted examples of leaderships I guess I could... the only objective thing would be like what we've accomplished so far  would that be interesting to you?|Interviewer: Mhm.|Interviewee: Um  so  uh  so we started this year essentially  and we were able to secure a lot of sponsorships from different companies such as City Sports  Dunkin Donuts  Copy Tech  as well as MIT sponsorships like the public service center  where they would give us about $3000 to do our project in January in Togo. And  an MIT office donated 62 laptops just this last week. So I think  like  we've been definitely doing well like getting our name out there and also  um  achieving what we've set out to do  which is improve healthcare. Um  well  the project hasn't essentially started but our mission was to provide technology to improve clinical efficiency there. So  um  having our first step sort of been made by securing these donations I think is a good step of us showing that we have been succeeding objectively  but  but yeah.|Interviewer: Do you consider yourself a team player? Can you give me an example where there was a conflict in your team and you had to resolve it?|Interviewee: Um  yes  so  I do think I've definitely learned a lot from this experiment  experience  to become more of a team player. And I think I  uh  I know what it takes to be a good team player  by seeing what doesn't work  what does work  qualities that I don't think work in other members in interactions that I've had. So  an example would be  uh  last year  when GlobeMed first started  I wasn't the co-president  but we had a set of co-presidents who were also starting out. So  to be fair  it was a totally new concept  new organization  and it's  their downfall is they weren't that motivated. They didn't really seem to care that much about the outcome of our organization. And for me and other members that really devoted ourselves to it  it really frustrated us  um  but we had to learn how to be team players in the sense that we couldn't just go out and do everything ourselves and risk stepping on their toes. We had to respect their position as our bosses essentially. And this definitely was difficult in a lot of ways  I think I learned that you have to know your bounds and know that you can't achieve everything. You can't always just brute force your way through things. I think that  um  it's always the best way  if you ever feel like any conflict is about to arise or if you feel uncomfortable at something  like  immediately schedule a time to meet with that person  just talk it out  completely respectfully  without approaching a bunch of people and asking what they think. It's just probably better to meet face to face with that person and settle it from the start. And then you know if things don't improve after that  there may be other things you can do involving other members  but I think it's best  just face to face  yeah  so much of our world is like by e-mail nowadays  so yeah.|Interviewer: Alright. If you were given the option to change one thing about yourself  what would it be?|Interviewee: In terms of leadership? Or  anything?|Interviewer: In terms of anything.|Interviewee: Oh. Hm. Well  my joke would be I wish I was taller  but  hahaha. Well  I wish I was more  I guess I would change  my  like  time management skills. Because I think I definitely am not as efficient as I'd like to be right now  especially as a student. Um  I think I spend a lot of time on Facebook. I do a lot of networking  which I think I justify to myself like 'Oh that's good for future endeavors ' but I really think I  like  I could be more efficient in terms of like  you know my free time in the summer  like  learn a new programming language. Like  that could be  that's always something I wanted to do but never end up doing. So  so yeah  I would probably change that.|Interviewer: Okay. And why do you think you should get the job?|Interviewee: Uh  I think I'm very like motivated. I think because I know how to act as a leader of a group. I may not be the most experienced in software development since I just started the major. I think I can direct a team of people very diverse from me and working very different from me because I think I'm a very vocal person. I think I communicate well  uh  with people  or attemptfully. And I think that can be useful when it's a team. And  I think software development  like a lot of people think  like  it's just one person in a group programming  but I think it really involves a lot of coordination among the team. I think I can contribute that way.",

It was originally aimed for just  ya know  local umm Boston girl's  so we did all the publicizing for that  I mean I know  get it a lot more publicity than we expected  people in from like California and stuff  so.|Interviewer: Oh  wow.|Interviewee: Yup.|Interviewer: Tell me about a time you were working on a team and faced a challenge.  How did you solve that problem?|Interviewee: Okay  umm so I guess I'm also a member of China Development Initiative  and so a lot of times  umm  when were in events most of them are within our own group so were brainstorming for like service leadership programs and stuff like that.  But umm we also try to do some events where we bring in professors and other speakers. So some of the big challenges we face include umm actually finding these speakers  getting them to really correspond with us.  Like sometimes they'll respond and be like oh  were interested  but then they just don't follow up  so going after them  kinda looking for that response.|Interviewer: Can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what your doing to overcome it?|Interviewee: okay  umm I would say I'm generally more of a passive person  when someone gives me a task I'll do it I won't really  like if i get stuck I'll kind of try to keep working on it myself instead of asking for help.|Interviewer: Mhmm.|Interviewee: Umm so I've been trying to umm  i guess talk to more higher ups  if i run into issues  or ask more questions i guess.|Interviewer: Great.

Uhm and I really enjoy anatomy  human anatomy. Uhm  so I think that's when i started thinking about medical field.|Uhm  and uhm after being able to shadow uhm a neonatologist in high school  I think that's when I kind of figured  this  like i want to work in pediatrics  and plus I love kids as well. That's when I really figured out that's |what I wanted to do. |Interviewer: mmhm. That's great. Could I get you to scoot over a little bit? |Interviewee: Left-right? |Interviewer: left  there you go. Uhm  Do you think you're a leader? tell me why.|Interviewee: I do beleive I'm a leader. Uhm  I do beleive I take initiative a lot. Uhm  one example that is uhm one of the student groups that I work with  I work with several actually  but one of uhm  an example from one  the one that I work| with is our black women alliance. Uhm  I'm on the executive board. But my role is pretty uh  It's kind of almost in the shadows. Uh I'm on the social committee. So I'm the representative for my class.| uhm  and uhm  I tend to kind of like  I guess because I'm more of an upperclassmen I can tend to just throw ideas and get people thinking uhm rather then you know  I guess direct people. I think I'm more of like an |Initiator uhm   then I let people ya know just do what they want with whatever it is they throw out there. Yes  I do believe I am a leader.|Interviewer: Okay  and do you consider yourself a team player? Can you give me an example of when there was a conflict in your team and you resolved it?|Interviewee: Um  yes i do beleive I'm a team player. Uh  another student that I work with  I work with several that I can mention. Uhm  are black student union and I'm on the executive board of  for the second time this year  uhm|and Im co-chair uhm this year and uhm  our executive board is pretty unique. Uhm even though I havent titled in co-chair  uhm  every member on the e-board has a really even role.|So it's really even split as far as like what we have  uhm  our responsibilities are  and how much our opinions weigh. uhm  and um  actually this current executive voard we had some rocky start at the beginning of the year. uhm  there was a lot of loss of communication  uhm things weren't getting done in a timely fashion. We weren't really making progress. uhm   collectively. Individually we were fine but collectively we weren't really moving forward. Uhm  But Uhm  we  A few of us noticed that fact that |we werent communicating and uhm  we actually thought it would be a good idea to kind of have like a  like a  de-breifing session where we kind of express  you know  what is wrong exactlly. Uhm  and how we can move forward and|we found out that ya know that we have to find a way to kind of communicate more even if its just sending a breif text every now and then saying what you are doing. Uhm  We should definitely communicate more often then we were doing. And|uh yes  we've been able to communicate more  more then some  we definitely  we definitely have a  long way to go but we're increasing communication uh  right now and uh  we're doing much better. And we're making a lot of progress now.|Interviewer: that's uh. If you were given the option to change one thing about yourself what would it be?|Interviewee: If I was given one option to change one thing about myself  Uh  I think it would be my hesitation. Uhm  Im pretty hesitant uhm about you know uhm  first ideas or initial thoughts that I have. Uhm I like always have to seek like a second opinion.| Or  I'll have to talk it out with someone or  sometimes I don't even talk about it all because um  I get maybe shy. I wouldn't exactly call myself shy but I guess when it comes to some opinions I might have i'm really |hesitant about sharing. Uhm  and that's one thing I'd definitely like to change because some  most of the time people say oh your idea was actually really cool. And I'm just like 'wow really'? So I guess I kind of doubt myself a lot.  | I think that's something that I'd really like to change. Because it hinders me a lot. Uhm I would really  I think it's something I need to work on. And I guess uhm  A way to improve that would again  doing more of the talking to people about how they feel about my idea. They think it's a good idea uhm and it has helped a little bit in the past but I need to work on that some more.|Interviewer: Great  and why do you think you should get into medical school?|Interviewee: I think I should get into medical school  uhm  because I do believe that I will make a good doctor. um  I'm a people person I love helping people. um  and I love kids um I love seeing um I guess their resilience when it comes to |their health. Um how they can just um  ya know  get better so quickly compared to adults. um and I want to I guess   um bring the knowledge that i gained from MIT um into the medical fiwld. Um |whether it's through  ya know  drugs  different drug discoveries and things like that and drug trials. Or um  even if it's just ya know  um kind of like the collaborative spirit we have at MIT campus  bringing it to a hospital setting.. setting  uhm because I know a lot of hospitals have just like a barrier between uh doctors and nurses  or doctors and patients  so uhm I feel like that's an attribute that I bring take around the world  kind of  and into a hosptial setting to alleviate situations like that.",

        "Transcript": "Interviewee: In my technical background  um. Been a junior at MIT. Um  I studied a lot of music  but I've been mainly studying robotics  mechanical engineering and a little bit of electrical uh  at MIT here. So  uh  I've done a few robot competitions  built a few  and um  you know  that's basically what I do  build robots and play music.|Interviewer: Excellent  yeah. So  do you think you're a leader? Can you tell me why?|Interviewee: I think I am a leader. Um  because um  I'm very calm. And I don't over react and I'm very good at  I wouldn't  handling is the wrong word. But I guess  you know  dealing with people and making sure that they can relate with other people. Making a team work. That type of stuff. Um  I like to think I'm pretty sociable. Um  I'm a nice guy and I'm easy to talk to and I think those are all very nice traits for a leader.|Interviewer: Mm-Hm|Interviewee: So  I would say yes  I'm a good leader and based on previous leadership experience I say that I did a pretty good job  so.|Interviewer: Do you think you're a team player? Can you tell me about a time when you were working on a team and you faced a challenge. How did you go about solving that challenge?|Interviewee: Um  I  I'd definitely say I'm a good team player. Now  are you asking about how I worked well with the team  or how well I worked bringing the team together or how well I worked  okay  well uh  I'll address all of them. Um  I guess  as a team member  I very quickly learned what my role was and asked you know  if there's anything I can do  what do I need to do? And I do that  fill that role. Um  but I'm also very good at you know  kind of combining all of the roles together. So  say  let's just  you know  on a robot  for example  there's mechanical  there's electrical  there's  there's code work that also needs to be put together. And  everyone can do a great job by themselves. But if they're not working together then you know  like if I don't know what the guy  the code guy is working on and what energy equations he needs and that type of stuff then I  as an electronic guy or as a mechanical guy like  it's not gonna work. Um  and that's how I guess I work well within a team is kind of bringing people together. Um  but  if there are any like  challenges I guess I faced as a team um  I guess  that really wasn't the question though was it. Could you repeat the question again  I'm sorry.|Interviewer: Do you consider yourself a team player. Give me an example where there was a conflict on your team that you had to resolve.|Interviewee: Okay  um  okay  so a recent project I worked on with friends. Um  there were these two guys. Love them to death  they're great guys  very talented  Tyler and Dan. They're very close. They've been very close for  I guess freshmen year. Um  they have one of those relationships where good  you know  good high points  but there's also like  they fight a lot. So  um  there were a couple moments where they were just pissed at each other. They hated each other. They couldn't work well together so  what I did was I kind of you know  told them take  take a step back. Tyler  we're gonna go to the student center. We're gonna grab some food  chillax and then we're gonna get back. And while we were walking to the student center I talked to him about it and talked to what his issues were. And then  on the way back  he was much more calm and things progressed a lot smoother and much faster. I would say.|Interviewer: Mm-hm  well  well  this helps. So  if you were to change one thing about yourself  what would it be?|Interviewee: One thing  okay. Um  I would say  time management.|Interviewer: Mm-hm|Interviewee: Definitely time management. Um  it's been rough my whole life. Um I'd say it's definitely been getting better but I've definitely had problems with  I'm very much living in the now and so sometimes I forget to think ahead. and  um  there have been many instances where I've got into trouble. I have a lot of work to do and it's you know coming up in like  a few days. And sometimes  I  I should work harder earlier on  but I don't get  you know  I don't get  I'm like  well I could work on it  but I've done enough tonight. Why don't I  I can figure it out tomorrow. And usually end up working really hard um  right at the end. Which I guess a lot of people end up doing but  if that was one thing I could change  I'd say definitely better time management  being able to spread it out more evenly and be more prepared.|Interviewer: Now  how about a job you'd like to have?|Interviewee: Okay.|Interviewer: Do you have one in mind?|Interviewee: Yeah.|Interviewer: Good. So  now  why should we give you this job?|Interviewee: Okay. Um  should I go with  just go with  let my imagination flow?|Interviewer: Sure.|Interviewee: All right.|Interviewee: Okay  so we're at a robotics interview. Um  well  I think I deserve this job  a lot because I've been working very hard. I know a ton of control background. I know a ton about robotics  mechanical engineering. Um  I've had a ton of um  hands-on work with robots. Um  and I know all the work that goes into it. Um  so as far as background and experience that I've had with robotics  I'd say I'm very well um  informed  I wouldn't say informed. I  experienced  I don't want to use the word experienced again but that's  I have a lot of experience in robotics. Um  and I've  since I've been working with it for such a long time  I can learn more about it quicker and I'm very  I'm very fast to learn. So  throw me in a new situation. I'll  you know  Oh  okay  I know what that is. I can relate to that and I just work from there. Um  and I think I'm a very  I work well with people so robotics is one of those things where you have to work with a bunch of  a group of people for a common goal. And I'd like to think that I'm very good at working with people so |Interviewer: Mm-hmm|Interviewee: Um  and it  it sounds like a fun place to work. I  I've talked to you know  some friends and some other people working there. And it's just  I'd really love to work there. And I think I'm a good fit.|Interviewer: Well thank you.

I totally  like  messed up. I thought we were at the media lab. But . . .|Interviewer: It\u2019s ok. So please tell me about yourself.|Interviewee: Ahh  hmm. So  uhh  I would- would say that the job I\u2019m interviewing for  let\u2019s stay down here. So  yeay   I\u2019m Chase  and I guess  um  I don\u2019t know. I really enjoy computers and outdoors  that\u2019s -that\u2019s generally what I give people. Um  so in both of these  um  in computers mainly  uhh  at MIT I think some of my favorite classes have actually been graphics . . .|Interviewer: Mmm-hmm.|Interviewee: . . . and computational photography as well. So it\u2019s actually been really interesting to me getting into harder problems. |Interviewer: Mmm-hmm.|Interviewee: Um  like really deep programming like C  I\u2019m actually getting more interested in. Whereas before when I came to MIT I had no idea about this stuff and I just did a lot of web-development.|Interviewer: Mmm-hmm.|Interviewee: Umm  otherwise I just . . . I really just enjoy working on random projects. Going to Aca-thons [SP?] a lot and hanging out with people. Umm  yeah. Just building cool things. Uhh  otherwise  uhh  my main thing I do afterwards is ultimate Frisbee  which I really enjoy.|Interviewer: OK  cool. Uhh  so  uhh  tell me about a time when you demonstrated leadership.|Interviewee: Uhh  actually that would probably be . . . I would actually put this on Frisbee.|Interviewer: [laughs]|Interviewee: Uhh  so I started the Frisbee club in my high school  um  my junior year. |Interviewer: Mmm-hmm.|Interviewee: And  umm  basically it was just a bunch of my friends. We used to play around a lot  and we said  \u201cHey  why don\u2019t we just make this a team?\u201d It was about 15 or 20 of us.|Interviewer: Mmm-hmm.|Interviewee: Umm  so I became captain and what that entailed was getting people to practices every day or maybe three times a week  depending on  like  how people\u2019s schedules were.|Interviewer: Mmm-hmm.|Interviewee: But it was definitely tricky because  I mean  we had to get  you know  at least 15 people out on the field to be able to actually play a game  because you need 7 on each side.|Interviewer: Mmm-hmm.|Interviewee: Umm  so  uhh  getting all this organized like everyday was umm  definitely like pretty hard to do. And I had to get people passionate enough to be wanting to play every time that we needed to play. Umm  and by the end  uhh  we went to a tournament in Texas . . .|Interviewer: Mmm-hmm.|Interviewee: . . .which is where I\u2019m from. Umm  and we got 5th my junior year and 3rd my senior year which is great without a coach or anything.|Interviewer: Mmm-hmm.|Interviewee: Umm  just a lot of playing around with my friends yeah.|Interviewer: So tell me about a time you were on a team and were faced with a challenge. How did you overcome it?|Interviewee: Uhh  hmm  OK. So let\u2019s- let\u2019s go with robotics. That was one of the classes I was in  uhh  last semester. So  umm  basically  uhh  the first half of the class was just learning in general about robots.|Interviewer: Mmm-hmm.|Interviewee: And figuring out  umm  you know  just like all the electronics first of all and then actually the computer sense behind it  doing vision and such. Umm  so finally at the very end of the  umm  uhh  class we had to make our own robots.|Interviewer: Hmm.|Interviewee: And so what I did there  umm  basically  uhh we had a few meetings to figure out what type of robot we would be building and stuff. Umm  and I guess  uhh  what I wanted to do was  umm  basically go ahead with everything we\u2019d already done. Uhh  and just push forward with that and just finish off basically. And what my team members wanted to do was actually redo everything and start from the very bottom.|Interviewer: Mmm-hmm.|Interviewee: Umm  so what we ended up doing  I actually took their side  umm  and it worked out very well. Umm  we had  uhh  quite a few tricky problems involved like  umm  uhh  one really cool thing we worked on was figuring out exactly  umm  how the robot can see the world . . .|Interviewer: Huh.|Interviewee: . . . and what we had with this  we had a tile floor that we kind of cheated with. We had a tile floor and then walls . . .|Interviewer: Mmm-hmm.|Interviewee: . . . everywhere. Umm  so what we were able to do is say  \u201cLet\u2019s just color the tile floor and wherever the coloring stops.\u201d|Interviewer: Huh.|Interviewee: \u201cSo let\u2019s look at all the light in the picture and whenever we don\u2019t see any white  that\u2019s actually the bottom of the wall.\u201d|Interviewer: Ahh.|Interviewee: Umm  yeah. So then we basically took all these points that existed  that represented roughly the bottom of the wall  and then basically ran that through an algorhythm that created it  uhh  turned it into a line. Umm  so yeah. That was- that was kind of what it was and it worked really well. In the end we actually had this vision turned on which is really tricky and . . .|Interviewer: Ohh.|Interviewee: I think the first time they\u2019d actually had  umm  some- something like this instead of just looking for balls and doing path planning. Umm  actually local- relocalization in the world.|Interviewer: Ahh. |Interviewee: Yeah.|Interviewer: So tell me about one of your weaknesses and how do you plan to overcome it?|Interviewee: OK  uhh  hmm. One of my weaknesses? Umm  I would go with  umm  . . . umm . . .Yeah I should\u2019ve had a better answer for this question . . .umm  I guess . . . I don\u2019t know if I can plan to overcome it. [laughing] I don\u2019t know.|Interviewer: You can pick anything.|Interviewee: I- I- I\u2019d actually say  umm  I- I wish I was a lot better in working- in working in teams. |Interviewer: Mmm-hmm.|Interviewee: Umm  so  I actually really enjoy working in teams in general and that\u2019s  umm  actually been one of my biggest focuses at MIT because I just know everyone is like really great at everything. Umm  but being able to  umm  basically inspire people to do stuff that I think is a good idea. |Interviewer: Hmm. Mmm-hmm.|Interviewee: Uhh  I have found that I\u2019m not the best at basically.|Interviewer: Mmm-hmm.|Interviewee: Umm  uhh  I mean just like  just- just various aspects of just everything. You know  like working in this social club where we just throw offense in general for students and you know  I\u2019ve got like various ideas that I need to get across to people but sometimes people don\u2019t agree with me and . . .|Interviewer: Hmm.|Interviewee: . . . I either have to be persuasive or something or come up with better ideas.|Interviewer: Mmm-hmm.|Interviewee: Umm  so  I guess- I guess my plan to overcome this  uhh  so far has basically just been a lot of practice . . .|Interviewer: Uhh.|Interviewee: . . . and just doing more  uhh  basically again  like I\u2019ve been doing a lot of teamwork in general. |Interviewer: Mmm-hmm.|Interviewee: I do really enjoy it. So I think it just comes with practice and being very conscious about how other people do stuff very well and inspire me  umm  so hopefully I can inspire others.|Interviewer: Mmm-hmm. Now why do you think we should hire you?|Interviewee: Umm  [laughs] uhh  I guess because  umm  I- I would probably say the one word comes down to passion.|Interviewer: Mmm-hmm.|Interviewee: Umm  I- whatever I\u2019m doing  I make sure  umm  to do it with everything that I have and I\u2019m- I\u2019m basically always thinking about the problems that I\u2019m working on. Umm I- I- I generally have like a pretty small scope of problems as well  that I always try to narrow it down. I\u2019m not- I can\u2019t take so many problems at the same time and try and solve all of them. If I\u2019m reading a book  I\u2019m only reading like one or two books.|Interviewer: Hmm.|Interviewee: Umm  but with this  umm  I don\u2019t know I- I- I\u2019ve found it so far to be really helpful. Umm  I think my passion generally overflows to other people. Umm  I- I think I\u2019m frequently jumping around  uhh  when I\u2019m doing stuff . . .|Interviewer: Hmm.|Interviewee: . . . and like explaining stuff and like listening to people. Umm  so I think I- I- I bring kind of some liveliness to places and also with this passion goes- I\u2019m always looking at new stuff  learning new stuff and- and teaching people about it  umm  and you know just enjoy making stuff.|Interviewer: Mmm-hmm.

Ready?|Interviewee: Yep.|Interviewer: So  tell me about yourself.|Interviewee: Uh  well I'm a Junior. I'm an MIT student. Um  I'm majoring in both Math and Computer Science. Uh what sort of skills and interests are you looking to find out about?|Interviewer: Oh just like a general idea of what your interests are and like you know what kind of goals you're looking for in terms of the future.|Interviewee: Cool  well I'm really interested in distributed systems actually and that's more of a research interest and the sort of application that it generally tends to have when I look at companies is parallel computing. Um  I actually did an internship last summer with Amazon and uh for them I ended up doing a lot of parallel computing with the hoodoo platform. I'm also taking 6172 which is a performance engineering class and we do a lot of parallelism in C++.|Interviewer: Great! So tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership.|Interviewee: Well  uh  this was in high school but in high school I was the  uh  president of our robotics team as well as the  uh  in the earlier years the head of  respectively the  the  uh mechanical engineering team and our mechanical arm team. Uh  and you know that was a good leadership experience uh  I've also been in  uh  in 6172 we have group projects - they're only two people - but um  in some of the projects I've been the person doing a lot of the organizing. Uh  yeah  um.|Interviewer: Okay. So tell me about a time you were working on a team and faced a challenge. How did you solve that problem?|Interviewee: Are you more interested in a technical challenge or like in a working with people challenge? |Interviewer: I mean any situation where you're working with people and there is an issue.|Interviewee: Okay. Well  um  in my 6172 class I'm taking right now I was working with Jason. He is a friend of mine and we were both working on the first project and we were trying to improve our speed in order to get up to the benchmark for like good fastness um  of improvement. And we had to prioritize different choices in terms of what might actually speed up our code by approximately five hundredfold. Yeah  it was pretty intense. And we as such like had to sort of try and paralyze the work and you know it was pretty hard because the code - like  merging two code documents is never fun and there was really only one document we were working on. What ended up happening is that I spent most of the time uh driving which is to say coding  him watching - verifying my algorithm. It was stressful because it was getting close to the deadline and if we didn't finish this optimization we'd have to turn in an old version which was only ten times faster as opposed to five hundred times faster. We ended up getting it not five hundred times faster  but one hundred times faster. I was quite pleased. Working with him was sort of both working on the strategies of how to fix the technical problem as fast as possible given that we had two peoples' worth of manhours but only n actual hours. Um  and thinking about solutions to that technical problem was interesting.|Interviewer: Okay  great. Can you tell me about one of your weaknesses and what you're doing to overcome it?|Interviewee: Uh  I  when I get stressed tend to get a little snippy with people I'm working with. I think it is not uncommon. Um  but definitely when I'm - especially when I'm tired it's like 4 AM in the morning and I'm working with people. When they're trying to explain something to me or I'm trying to explain something to them there's like inherent overhead and that can be very frustrating. It causes me to like  be short with people when like they're trying to explain things to me or I'm explaining things to them. And it's something I'm working on because it doesn't actually make communication more effective  it just makes everyone unhappy. Um. One of - so - there's a couple things one is that like I have to stay up late working on things so I inevitably get practice working at not being snippy. Um  but also like having recognized that this is something that I do  something that is not effective for communication  uh  I have been trying to pay attention to  um  you know  my tone of voice  my friendliness and I've been trying to take the approach that when I do have to try to communicate in these situations  to like  optimize by minimizing the communication needed and being expressively relaxed during the periods of communication. Because even if I need to be like  working hard and stressing out about the work  the communication portion doesn't need to take up much time. And so if it takes like twice as long  it doesn't matter  because that's not the time you need to optimize.|Interviewer: Great! Last question - why do you think we should hire you?|Interviewee: I think you should hire me because I'm technically qualified  I get along well with people  I am interested in these fields. Like  I'm excited about Computer Science it's like what I want to do. It's a large part of who I am - the Math and Computer Science part of me. And as a result  I'm going to enjoy work  and enjoy working with people. Um  also the people I spend my time with outside of work will tend to be very similar kinds of people to the kinds of people I'll be interacting with at work. And so  it tends to work out pretty well. In my previous internship with Amazon my team liked me a lot because I'm pretty laid back and enjoy joking around with people. Bake food  you know. So I  yeah  you know I will solve your technical problems and I will get along with the team.|Interviewer: Great!",
